s,"Sober date from alcohol (12/30/20) &amp; am doing well so far...So I've had depression/gad since I was a wee-lad. I'm 30 (m) now. I drank and smoked my twenties away, even though I was a full-time workaholic too. Still saw ladies. Had circle of friends. In 2016, almost five yrs ago, I cut off all ties with my mother and, despite her trying to contact me through letters and text up until 2019, I completely still shun her with no regrets after the abuse &amp; mistreatment my father and I both suffered at her hands. She's chosen her life &amp; so-called priorities over anyone else- including her only offspring. She made me more insecure, nervous, and self conscious about myself during my teenage years than I ever had to be despite being friends and knowing virtually everyone in my school. She was controlling and self absorbed (also an alkie, I might add.  She'd drink wine like water during her cancer scare and came from a born and bred Irish family full of drinkers.)&amp;#x200B;Reason for writing this (sorry if that seemed off topic in comparison to what I'm about to bring up) is that all my lady-friends and girlfriends. crushes, etc. etc. even close friends have all moved on with good jobs and even getting engaged/married while I confine myself to the room in my dad's pad. I was a victim of police brutality two yrs ago when a cop kicked my back and fractured it. Ive had withdrawal seizures from the meds I took to relieve the trauma in the first place leading to further hospitalisation. 2020 obviously was not a good yr but neither were the previous several yrs. I became a self-destructive alcoholic (one week sober today) &amp; isolated myself from the world, having been out of work not just cus of the pandemic but due to my injuries &amp; surgeries and personal problems.&amp;#x200B;Now I feel a complete washup failure, but getting to the substance (finally). One of the first major loves of my life back when we were like fourteen, fifteen yrs old is now a school counselor and recently got engaged. I saw it coming and quite frankly I don't care but it astounds me why I spent my kid yrs obsessing over someone I could never and would never have. My energy could've gone into a girl more appreciative and thoughtful and loving, even if it was just a friend or something, happiness was hard to come by. after noticing her flaunting her ring on her IG profile pic, instead of flipping a shit, or being overreactive like I would have fifteen yrs ago (I got jealous as a kid even just seeing her in the hallways in Junior HS friendly conversating w/ other guys instead of me), I just closed my laptop shut and went right to sleep. and I slept like a rock. Even with my terrible back pain.&amp;#x200B;I don't know what bugs me out most. Me not getting what I feel I deserve or always watching others go down the right track instead of me or a combination of these things. My sexual drive has gone down drastically too no longer filled with angsty hormones which I think is partially why Idgaf about things like women now- feels like a unfair competition to see who's the happiest. But I fully embraced that fact, got closure, said ""f-ck it"" and went to sleep last night instead of crying to myself like a wimp. WTH is going on with me? Maybe it's just me overanalyzing things like usual but it's truly remarkable how numb I've grown to personal relations and that stuff. I've changed drastically throughout my life I would've never recognized myself.

c,"1.Yes I have sciatica when bending forward and I get it down the left leg. I use to quite often when my back was agitate maybe about 6 months ago, however switching to a standing desk has helped greatly with the sciatica and also stretching/ walking.

c,"Hello!  Straight out of university I was in a codependent relationship, and I really struggled to decide on a job and what I wanted to do because I was trying to plan my life around him. I suffered a lot of anxiety over that year. I finally landed a job I was happy with, but between the interview and starting the job, there were two bereavements in my family. It was a really difficult time, and the boyfriend was not as supportive as I needed.  I moved into a new house share, started my job, and then a week after that relationship ended. At this point I really had not a lot to give and I tried to numb a lot of the feelings out. At the weekends I tried to numb out all the pain by drinking a lot with people I didn't like that much. Nearly every weekday I ordered a takeaway and watched TV. My boss in the job was very absent and so I really struggled and didn't understand what I was meant to be doing a lot of the time. My house share was falling to pieces, the bed gave me back pain, frequently the boiler broke and we had no hot water. Three months into the job was when I first started to have suicidal thoughts.  Eight months into the job a colleague of mine called me to say he was getting divorced. I cared a lot about him and tried to help, but I started to develop feelings, which in hindsight was another way to numb out how I was feeling. I continued to drink too much, I moved out on my own and three months after that I developed borderline psychosis and tried to follow my colleague home. By this point I was having suicidal thoughts several times a day. That was my rock bottom.  After that I sought therapy, dived into self help books, went to yoga 3-4 times a week and immersed myself in good mental health and self care. I learnt to express my emotions better, reach out to people when I need help. Despite the restrictions this year, I have even managed to reach out and make some new friends. I have since got a promotion into a role I much prefer and I actually enjoy work most days now. I haven't drunk alcohol in 112 days and I have just bought my first home.

c,"Thank you for asking! Holy hell!  With my first, my sciatica never acted up during my glorious unicorn pregnancy. I'd had some issues in the past. But it just never occured to me as a 'thing' to look out for. It became a thing in the middle of labor, however. It was worse than contractions. I couldn't speak, my flesh felt like it was on fire where they put the fetal monitors. This was after several hours of contractions. And I'd gotten to a sort of zen-point during them. Then bam! Huge pain. To this day, I swear it was worse than giving birth. :( Baby must have sort of down shifted on my nerve and I had dialated a lot during that time also. I somehow managed to get an epidural and immediately felt better and clear headed and could speak. I felt SO much better. But it was realistically maybe an hour of me writhing in pain before they got the epidural guy to show up and calm me down enough with some other drugs so they could stick me.  Then I proceeded to on to the pushing part without any hitches. Needed one stitch and was wide awake and nursing baby. Had no issues with the nerve afterward. I was pretty annoyed to learn that was a thing that could happen tho! No one had told me about that, and I guess there's stretches and therapy you can do to help prevent that? I'd really hoped for not using the epi. Turns out it was super awesome in my case. And really it was a pretty positive birth experience other than that whole sciatica issue. :-/  With my 2nd I was concerned it would happen again. I had super bad pelvic pain during pregnancy and she was threatening to be a big baby. I thought I'd have the same issues during L&amp;D.

There is a higher incidence of code blues, trauma alerts, code oranges (behavioral emergency) and a higher likelihood that patients might fall out of bed and injure themselves. Our lovely dementia patients will often act out of turn, getting combative and unruly.I will also admit that patient mortality just seems higher during the night, making it emotionally harder than the other shifts. The particular ward that I work on is about the length of a football field, perhaps longer, thanks to our 'luxurious' single patient rooms. It's easy to admit that after a night of chasing after 15 different people, with varying needs and illnesses, I'm quite tired. All of this aside, I'm coming here today after working an 8 night stretch. The first seven were hellish, with patients that were out of control and overly demanding. I'm not one to complain: I accepted the job, and I accept all that happens during the shift as a result. On my eighth night, I begrudgingly entered the ward, expecting to hear the usual screams, unending alarms, call bells and so on. I was met with near silence. Looking pleased as punch, the ward clerk handed the census sheet to me. I pored over it, gladly noticing that most of our beds were empty. The patients that we had were simple enough: stomach upsets, back pain, chronic cough.. All very routine things that should make the night a breeze. As I went to hand the paper back to the clerk, my eye caught a note next to a patient's name. ""Patient terminal, comfort care initiated.""This is not my first healthcare job, nor was I green. The idea of death was no longer unsettling. Yet I still felt the anchor drop into my guts. As healthcare workers, we form callouses to the things that might upset people outside of the job, yet we remain human. This was someone's mother, wife, sister, best friend. To top it off, she was under my care. After passing the paper off, getting report and settling into my nightly routine, I made sure to pass her room more than once. Her nurse mentioned that death was imminent, and as I cleared the mucus from her lips and readjusted her pillow, I agreed. I noticed her face in the way that we do when we know someone is coming to pass. I followed the wrinkles around her eyes, her cheeks. I stared into her half-open, distant eyes. I noticed that they were blue, much like my own grandmothers. The anchor in my gut dropped further, into a deeper place that can only be described as the top of my soul. I gripped her hand gently. It was cold, sweaty, limp. I smiled a half smile, explained that I would come back around in just a moment, and excused myself. She met me with no reply, and that was fine. She was focusing on breathing. I walked down my hallway, passing donated art without seeing it. I contemplated on human life and death, as one might, barely glancing into my empty rooms. I rounded on my patients, one by one, making sure they were either sleeping or resting comfortably. My mind went to other things, stocking supplies and so forth. Rounding a corner, my eyes caught the sight of someone wearing black crossing the hallway. I didn't think much of it. Our hospital chaplain often comes in the night. As minutes became hours, the night wore on. It grew steadily quieter. No alarms rang, and it seemed that the world was at peace. Finally done with my paperwork, I traipsed up the hall to give it in to the clerk. On my way, I passed the room of the woman who was passing. At the foot of her bed stood a man, arms at his side, staring across her body as it slowly surrendered. It must still be the chaplain, I thought plainly. My boots echoed in the silence as I placed the papers on the clerks desk. ""Father McClinton's here to see Mrs. Archer, eh?"" I asked with a small smile. ""What? Father McClinton isn't here. He's been at home for the past week with the flu.."" she replied. My tongue shriveled between my teeth. ""Then.. Is her family here?""""No. She hasn't had any visitors.""My heart pounded wildly as I turned on my heels and stared down the hallway. My brain spun as my old, trusted boots carried me towards her room. The nurses stared after me as I nearly broke into a sprint, breathing heavily. The hallways in my ward are about the length of a football field, her room being more towards the back end. I nearly missed her room as I flew past the confused stares of my coworkers. My hand reached out and grabbed the doorframe causing me to practically slam into the wall. My eyes quickly scanned her room, seeing no one but her. ""Mrs. Archer?"" I asked in a voice that was higher than I'd like. She was barely breathing. Her throat gurgled with mucus and spit. My heart slammed into my sternum as I rested my hand on her chest. 60 seconds passed as I counted out each breath she took. One every 30. Tears stung my eyes as I watched her jugular bounce in her throat. I did not bother to count, as I knew exactly what was coming. I felt the nurses behind me, staring down as she gasped and wheezed. Finally, the jugular began to slow. One breath in a minute. One every two. At long last, one became zero. My head dropped to my chest. Wordless and breathless myself, I lifted my hand and began to walk away. My wrist found itself wrapped in a firm grip. Startled, I looked down. She stared up at me, both eyes blue, both fixed on me. Her lips moved rapidly, babbling in a language that perhaps was not English. Pulling me down against her body, she wrapped me in the strongest hug I have ever felt. Scared halfway out of my wits, I tried to pull back. My cheek fell against her neck, and in my confusion, I must have missed the fact that I felt no pulse. The nurses screamed and fleed from the room. Terrified now, I put my hands against the mattress in a half-assed attempt at a pushup. She gripped me tighter, and whispered in my ear. On her breath, I smelled her death. ""I love you, my son."" It was then her arms released, and her body relaxed. I flew up and off of her, falling backwards onto the floor. My breaths came out in short bursts, imitating screams. Her head fell to the side, her eyes staring at not much else but me. I staggered out of the hallway, and vomited. Trying to get as far away from her room, my legs carried me into an empty room. I fell forward onto my hands and knees, gasping for air. My eyes opened, looking at the floor yet not seeing it. As they focused, they noticed the toes of black boots. I slowly looked up, seeing nothing but black cloth. It was then I stared into the face of Death, and it was then that He stared back at me.

c,"Part 2: "" I adore the other members of the faculty. They are some of my dearest, deepest friends in the world, and I only see most of them these two weeks out of the year. So these weeks are like a connection extravaganza--every conversation goofy and meaningful, loving and alive. I’m so glad Jara is back this year. I’ve missed her caustic kindness. And Christi? What did I do without Christi last year? We eat bad cafeteria food together, and complain about the lack of vegetables, mildly. This year, we're staying on the top floor of Sitka's nursing home. Don't ask. It's weird. There are beeping alarms and old women in wheelchairs with blue bows in their hair and heart monitors attached to the wall alongside our beds. But we have the entire third floor, and every time I open my door, I see someone with whom I want to talk, someone whom I hug. About forty-five hugs a day. Every evening, we gather at the ArtShare, in which someone, or several someones, presents his or her art. It's astonishing. And it always makes me want to work.  I love looking out the window and seeing all the masts of sailing ships in the harbor, bunched together in front of Mount Edgecumbe. And the blue, blue sky outside, on this glorious, unusual day. Aren’t they all unusual? Hot today. A little muggy. I ran all the way back to town, when I had nearly reached campus, because I suddenly remembered that I had left my wallet on the little shelf beneath the pay phone, outside the outdoor clothing store. I panicked, because I have all the cash from the faculty for the bonfire tonight, all of it tucked in there. Ack! And of course, I can only run so far. But when I finally reached the foyer, panting, I found it lying there, with a newspaper I had been reading. Not only that, but tourists were swarming the area, and no one had lifted it. So I love humanity again.  That view from Reber’s beach is truly one of the most, if not the most, beautiful sights I have ever seen. Green water, made deeper green when the sun hits it right. Dark fir trees topping little islands. We pointed out sunlight streaking the green water, eagles on wooden poles, shafts of light among the trees, pointed them out to each other. And there were bald eagles and black birds calling outside the window, diving down to the water and soaring up on widespread wings. The eagles, when they land, keep their wings tufted up until they balance in the top of the tree, then let their feathers settle softly. A snow-covered mountain out his living room window. It just moves me to tears. Vastness. And on top of that, add bonfires, back rubs, smores, and roasted bananas. Could there be anything more beautiful?  God, I love my job. This is an endless well of happiness. Kristin and I were talking about this at lunch, over bad food and too-sweet cake--how creative teaching is. When you move away from the rote expectations, you trust the process. Have a rough outline, and then let the moments determine themselves.  Goddamn it, Reber beat me at Scrabble again. I claim bad back pain as a distraction. Rematch next year.  A kid named Marley told a hilarious story about his hippy mom picking up a hitchhiker, and somehow connecting it to a local man who had cremated his wife. “He turned her ashes into these wacky beads. He put one on top of a mountain. He wanted to put one down the throat of a lion, one down the throat of a baboon. And he gave one to me.” He’s a natural. He had us all rapt and laughing.

c,"With a few caveats, the same as anyone else.  If you have a personal or family history of bone, heart, or joint problems, get an opinion from the relevant professional.  If you and your family are just disgustingly healthy, you should, in any case, get a basic checkup from a sports, SPORTS, orthopedist. I assume that you have or will have a gym membership.  I want you to pick up [this book,](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-3rd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0982522738) and read it thoroughly, because even if you don't take up barbell training (or don't take it up right away), there is a ton of good information in that book.  That being said, for now free weights are less important than just building up some basic strength, and you can do that pretty easily and safely on machines.  Just stick to the leg press, arm press (like a bench press, but with a machine), back extension, and lat pull-down for now. * Chest press:  Make sure you keep your elbows close to your ribcage; don't flare them out so that your upper arms are horizontal relative to the ground.  [This is good.](http://cdn.builtlean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Bench-press-form-7.jpg)  [This is bad.](http://cdn.builtlean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Bench-press-form-6.jpg)  The picture is actually of bench press, but the principle is identical.  Make sure the bars that you push on rest at the BASE of your palm, not the middle of it.  We want the force to be pushed through your arm bones, not twisting your wrist.  Here's a diagram.  The red line represents the bar, and the diagram shows your hand as you set up the grip and right before you close it round the bar. * Leg press: Push through your heels and not your toes, squeeze your butt (for the first few sessions, anyway).  Put your feet in the upper half of the plate, not the bottom half, about shoulder width apart. * Back extension:  Arch your back at the end of the back extension, and take it easy with this exercise.  If something doesn't feel right, back off on the weight. * Lat pull-down:  Initiate the movement by tensing your abs, then pull from the armpit; imagine yourself pinching your armpits closed to initiate the movement, then as it continues, imagine chains attached to the points of your elbows, and imagine someone pulling down on them.  At the bottom, pinch your shoulderblades together. There will undoubtedly be people who say that these lifts can/should be done differently, blah, blah, blah.  True.  But these are the best ways for a *beginner* to do them. For each, three sets of ten reps at a weight challenging but not too stressful, three times a week, and for the first few sessions, you'll have to play around with the weight a bit before you get it right; your body changes a LOT in that time.  The reps should be slow and smooth, but not too slow. What you can start RIGHT NOW is stretching.  Specifically improving your flexibility to the point where you can get into a [deep squat](http://www.reboundsportspt.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/squat.jpg) and be comfortable in it.  Some folks call this a ""third-world squat,"" but I like to call it a ""paleo squat,"" which sounds ridiculous and contrived, but less magnificently racist than the alternative.  The reason we want you to be able to do this is because it will make your strength training more effective, and the flexibility that this imparts to your hamstrings, hips, and back will alleviate a lot of difficulty moving around and a fair bit of back pain.  Check out [this article](https://www.t-nation.com/training/third-world-squat) for more info, and for ideas on how to ease into it. Finally, shoes.  [See these shoes?](http://www.planetshoes.com/mmplanet/Images/5355/5355_208_zoom.jpg)  I know you have a pair (or something similar) and that you use them when walking.  NEVER use them for weightlifting.  That big, thick, comfy sole is bad juju for weightlifting.  First of all, by increasing the distance of your ankle from the ground, it increases the torque on it, and therefore increases the likelihood of rolling your ankle when under load, sometimes by as much as 50%.  Second, the squishiness reduces your ability to sense when potential twists and rolls are likely to happen, which is bad, and finally, for physiological reasons too involved to go into here (as I review this whole post, it may be too late for that sort of caveat), a squishy sole can actually reduce the amount of force you can produce.  You want shoes that have a thin, incompressible, flexible sole.  Dance slippers are great if your gym allows them, other alternatives would be the New Balance WT10, the Merrell Vapor Glove, or, if you want to get funky, Vibram FiveFingers of one sort or another.

c,"&gt;Hi everyone. I am 21f about to be 22f. I have had my period since I was 12 and have gone on birth control shortly after to control heavy bleeding. I ALWAYS had regular cycles (I consider myself lucky in that aspect) I went off of birth control for no particular reason in September 2019 (not trying to get pregnant, just wanted to understand how my body reacted to no hormones) I go for my annual each year at the Gyno. I think I have complained about pain to my Gyno every year since I started seeing her (pain with sex, heavier bleeding on BC, uncomfortableness down there in general) she switched me to different BC’s, gave me a pelvic exam and an ultrasound, nothing has ever come of it but a cyst which went away after my cycle. &amp;nbsp; &gt;Since being off BC I noticed my periods have extremely heavy days for 3 days straight then barely anything. The bleeding is so heavy, I am so not used to it. It takes everything out of me. But it only lasts for a short amount of time. My cycle is still regular, I don’t get any abnormal bleeding. During ovulation, I get insane period cramps and lower abdominal pressure. I get this feeling sometimes when I sit like a shooting pain and pressure in my uterus. Back pain too. I have always just said this was ovulation, but I don’t exactly know. During sex, I noticed that it can feel good in the moment, but immediately after I’m doubled over in period like cramps mixed with the feeling of a bruised uterus. &amp;nbsp; &gt;Also during sex, it has been feeling like he has been poking a bruise in there, or poking something sensitive. I never got full enjoyment out of sex, even on BC. It just never felt good for me. I always had some type of pain with it, ESPECIALLY deep penetration. I’m fed up with this and I’m seeing my Gyno on Friday. I’m not sure if I should go back on BC or if she will even listen to me about my pains. She has always seemed like the type to dismiss me because my pelvic exam is fine. I’m not even sure if this sounds like endo, or a cyst, I seem to have a mix of everything, I was wondering if anyone has relayed to these pains in any way? &amp;nbsp; Hey /u/poppyjayy, it looks like you posted a wall of text.

s,"**TL;DR**: Thought I was 30-35% based on reference pics. Based on body fat caliper &amp; skinfold measurement, I'm closer to 24%.My stats for reference: M/29/5'10"" [SW:245,CW:195=50lbs] (19 months)Having lost a big chunk of weight over the past year &amp; a half, I recently became incredibly interested in preserving my lean muscle mass &amp; metabolism. In fact, I've posted several threads on this sub over the past few days showing my research &amp; thoughts:* [Doing IF everyday with a caloric deficit: does it lower your metabolism? My personal research, analysis, and recommendation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/e7u9kk/doing_if_everyday_with_a_caloric_deficit_does_it/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)* [Diet breaks and body recomposition: 2 strategies for combating metabolism reduction (a.k.a. adaptive thermogenesis) while burning fat.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/e89ic4/diet_breaks_and_body_recomposition_2_strategies/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)While the above research all represent good ideas in theory, the best way to see if they worked would be to actually test them. Now, you can't very well measure your progress without the ff.:1. a measurable metric that represents progress towards your goal. My goal is to preserve (&amp; maybe even increase) lean muscle mass while reducing fat. Since directly measuring the former is quite difficult, I'll measure the latter (body fat mass).1. a reliable measuring tool of the chosen metric. In this case, a scale alone is woefully inadequate. I could be losing weight, yes, but who's to say it's purely body fat? The key is to measure body fat percentage (BF%) as well, and an affordable &amp; convenient way to do this is with a fat caliper.1. a baseline value.While not as accurate as a DEXA scan, measuring skinfold with a body fat caliper works a lot better for tracking BF% trends over time. Still, the absolute value it produces can be off by several percent. Despite this caveat though, I still expected the initial value to be in the ballpark of 30-35%, which is the body type my (highly untrained) eye equated my current body pictures to when looking at reference images. For reference, I posted [my current body](https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/e97btf/m29510_22519530lbs_18_months_sedentary_w_sciatica/) in r/progresspics (NSFW pic: fat man in birthday suit).So, I ordered a caliper online, which arrived earlier today. After reviewing its manual, watching this video on how &amp; which body parts to measure, and plugging the values into [this skinfold BF% calculator](https://www.health-calc.com/body-composition/skinfold-d-and-w), I got a value:[24.0% body fat.](https://imgur.com/CsS4EmI)**WHAT.** It was unbelievable. I carefully reran the measurements again, and came up with the same average values. Even now, I'm still a little skeptical of the result. It's just so much lower than even my most optimistic estimate of BF%. There's no doubt that retrying a skinfold measurement with different calipers or different calculators will give me other (probably higher) values, just like how no two scales give you the same value.In the end, the absolute value itself isn't even a critical part of my measurement goal. It's simply a baseline that will help me track my ability to preserve/increase my lean muscle over time. Still. If I were to allow myself a small glimmer of hope that my true BF% is w/in a few percent of 24%, it would make me so happy. It would mean that, assuming I maintained the same lean muscle since my SW of 245lbs, I burned **over half** of my body fat while on keto &amp; IF.This presents in interesting conundrum. I'm currently trying the Body Recomposition strategy (see above) to improve my metabolism while on a caloric deficit by growing muscle. Now, this strategy works best the more obese you are. But if I'm 24% BF, this puts me on the upper end of Average, and far closer to a healthy weight than I previously expected. This means I'll have a harder time growing muscle.I'm committed, though. Maybe even more than before. My new lifestyle has fundamentally changed my body &amp; outlook in life, and I'm only halfway done. Starting last month, I upgraded from 16:8 to OMAD, as well as start daily morning walks (vs. staying in my room 99% of the day). Starting last weekend, I started lifting for the first time ever to improve my sciatica. Both the walks &amp; strength training will help me preserve or gain muscle needed to keep my metabolism up.Life gets in the way. Frequently. I've stalled many times, and some weight regains last months at a time. The added physical stress of OMAD &amp; extra exercise has gotten me sick &amp; sleep deprived a few times while my body adjusts.But I'm in it all the way.",0.556592,0.551485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19425444596443228

c,"I was in college (19 or so) but home for spring break.  Well, we had spaghetti for dinner, and my sister and I took our food upstairs to watch something on tv.  We had eaten and were just on her bed watching the show.  I,  being the big sister, decided she needed a wet willy, since I had t seen her in awhile.   She starts freaking and yelling at me, but I held her down and got her.  All of a sudden she starts gagging. I get up and she sits up, leans over the bed and pukes all over.     My slippers had been on the floor and there, on the toe of one, is a sliced mushroom. Not chewed, not bitten, just a slice of mushroom, at least 2 inches long.   I start laughing and yelling “why is there a whole mushroom??!!” My sister gets up and goes running for the bathroom.   I stand at the door, laughing hysterically, watching her puke more, and still exclaiming about the whole mushroom.

s,For the last 3 weeks I've been jumping rope on a Tabata timer to increase RMR and improve V02 max. Today after my session I noticed some significant back pain in my mid back. The pain was in the center and somewhat above the bottom of my rib-cage. I'm not sure if this is just muscle pain or something more serious. Oh... About 5 years ago I got an injury in approximately the same area when a motorcycle fell from a lift and I caught the brunt of the weight. Any way here are my questions... &amp;nbsp;* Is mid-back muscle pain common for jumping rope? Maybe I'm being paranoid thinking I've excited an old injury.* I'm looking for some calisthencis exercises to strengthen that area of my back. Any recommendations?* Any good calisthenics exercises that could replace jumping rope? I'm looking for low impact in case this back thing is serious.

After she made an attempt to overdose I called an ambulance and she was treated and put on a psychiatric hold. A few months after that my father suffered a tonic clonic seizure and had to have a shoulder replacement, and a few months after that he suffered another and required his second shoulder to be replaced and was diagnosed with epilepsy.  Luckily, after the second surgery my mother's meds started working and I had her to help me out at that point. But prior to that? I was alone.  I'm 27 and live at home with my parents.  My brother is mentally handicapped and can be draining as well.  But prior to my mom getting better? I had to do literally everything, how could I not when my parents were always so great to me.  Neither of them could drive (my mom did after she got better, my dad got the okay on October of this year) so I had to take all three of them to doctors appointments and the like. I had to run our business which I didnt know anything about.  I had to cook, clean and do laundry for everyone and had to put my life on hold. And I did it with a fucking smile.  Fast forward to today. My dad is infinitely better minus back pain and osteoporosis. My mom is doing amazingly.  But now I just feel, so empty.

c,"There's a difference between the religious purpose (Abraham's covenant with god) and the prevalence of circumcision in America today. From [here](https://matthewtontonoz.com/2015/01/05/why-is-circumcision-so-popular-in-america/): &gt; the American medical fascination with the procedure can be traced to the enthusiasm of a New York-based orthopedic surgeon named Lewis Sayre. In the 1870s, Dr. Sayre—who would go on to become president of the American Medical Association—developed a theory about the value of circumcision in treating muscle paralysis. The theory depended on the then-popular notion of reflex neurosis, which held that many diseases were caused by persistent stimulation of the nervous system by “irritation.” Dr. Sayre believed that by removing the foreskin he could eliminate one form of this “irritation” and thereby relieve the paralysis. (Interestingly, this was also the basis for removing a woman’s ovaries to combat hysteria and backache.) Sayre’s intervention, which he first performed on a 5-year-old boy suffering from leg paralysis, was the beginning of the American medical appropriation of what had been a primarily religious ritual. &gt; What Sayre began, other physicians continued with gusto. Circumcision was used to treat conditions as varied as asthma, epilepsy, hernia, and indigestion. When reflex neurosis eventually fell out of medical fashion as an explanation for illness, other uses were found for the procedure. Increasingly, doctors said circumcision could prevent a number of conditions, including venereal diseases like syphilis and gonorrhea, masturbation, and cancer. In 2020, we know this to be quackery at its finest. But if your grandfather was circumcised, and your father was circumcised, then why wouldn't *you* be circumcised?

c,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.*** Horrible title. Very long story so had to trim a lot. Summary: My mom is visiting and wanted to go to a store to get dinner stuff. BF said no. A huge fight breaks out and now I've been disowned.  &amp;#x200B; My mom is visiting for the past week for my BFs graduation. She's helped redecorate the house, cook dinners, clean, pack my lunches, etc. We never asked her to do any of it, but we appreciated it. We've tried to cook or clean and she prefers to do it herself. We've watched shows and played games she wanted and have tried our best to accommodate on top of our daily schedules. &amp;#x200B; Yesterday I get home from a tough day at work. We discuss dinner and she wants to go to a store 18 minutes away for a specific ingredient. BF is the only one who drives and was tired/bad back pain, so he didn't want to go. My mom gets upset and goes upstairs, coming back down in Spanish (BF doesn't speak) saying we haven't done anything she's wanted to do and can't believe we won't go to a store for her to make us dinner. &amp;#x200B; It escalates into: I've been your slave, I busted my ass for his graduation, I've cooked and cleaned, you haven't taken me anywhere (I work and it's been storming here), etc. Eventually, we keep arguing, and she gets dressed and leaves to go walk, in a city she doesn't know, in the rain and dark. She leaves and I just breakdown, sobbing hysterically. BF has no clue what is being said, only that we're arguing, and then sees me breaking down. He comforts me and says he can't believe my own mom can treat me like this. Fyi, my mom and I argue a lot and it always leaves me in shambles and he's the one helping my mental health after. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, we go out walking around trying to find her. She won't answer calls. I tell BF to stay home in case she makes it back. I told him not to get involved. Mom's BF is calling me saying how could I let this happen and why I didn't just go to the store. After like 2 hours, she gets home before me. BF loses his cool, slams the door in her face, and tells her she's crazy and abusive. Of course, Mom loses her shit. &amp;#x200B; Since then, we've been arguing constantly. I think everyone fucked up. Me for starting the argument I guess and not just going to the store. I think BF crossed the line extremely. Mom for making it so dramatic and not respecting our wishes. She also refuses to listen to BF's apology. BF for stepping in when I asked him not to and saying such extreme things.  &amp;#x200B; Mom and I argued this morning before I left for work. It got physical. She told me to never talk to her again since I care more about my BF than her. I asked her to acknowledge she played a part in this and she said she didn't do anything wrong and it's all our fault for being so disrespectful. &amp;#x200B; So, AITA for not wanting to go to the store? Is my mom's reaction justified? In her mind, ""I wanted to go so I can make you guys dinner and you guys are so lazy and inconsiderate to your guests"". *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Two days ago, I headed to the gym for legs day and I hurt lower back while doing weight squats. Afterwards, I got home, horny and jerked off (is that TMI?). It is unfortunate that we scheduled the booty call after I JO-ed and hurt my back. But whatever, I was parched (lol). Anyway, he came over to my place after work and we made out and all. It was all good, I was getting hard and we undressed and were doing some foreplay. However, I progressively felt that he was too aggressive for my liking. His kissing felt too rushed, his foreplay felt too quick, and his touches were too fleeting. I was initially hard when he was blowing me, but at some point, I got soft. My cock even got numb. I don't really know the reason why I got soft. Nonetheless, I couldn't do much so he was mostly topping me and he came twice. I, too, came in the end, but unfortunately, I had to jerk myself off.Could it have been my back pain? Or my masturbation the day before? Or I was simply not that into him?

I couldn't feel any pain in my back so later on that day I hit the gym and did some fairly light squatting. Then I felt pain in my lower back and stopped after a little because it felt too painful to keep going. When I got home and hit the bed to watch som TV, when I wanted to get up and do some other stuff I had really bad pain in my lower back.At first I thought i might have been overtraining my lower back, so I took 3 weeks off training. No changes so I visited my doctor. he wasn't the best (a creepy dude tbh.) but he told me to rest and then it would be gone...Of course I didn't think it would be the best, because I just did that already.I visited a Physiotherapist and had 4 sessions w/o any improvements. Then I tried kiropractor which helped my back a lot.

s,"Ilona - 15/01/2013  @ 1.08am, 1.56kg My oncologists decided I needed to be induced at 32 weeks so that I could have a PET scan to determine whether the tumours in my abdomen and neck where still active. I was pretty upset, we had discussed the option of waiting until I was at least 36 weeks, the oncologists, haemotologists, obstetricians and neonatalogists had a bunch of meetings and decided it would be too risky. The type of lymphoma I have is just too aggresive. Lucky for me, my cervix had started to shorten mid December, so we decided to have a go at inducing a vaginal birth.So, on the 13th of January, I was giving prostoglandin gel and admitted into maternity at the Royal Brisbane Womens Hospital. I had blood tests done and discovered that the last round of chemo had made me neutropenic, meaning I had no immune system. The maternity ward isn't the best place for someone with neutropenia. I was horrified when a midwife went to take my obs without washing her hands.By 2am I was struggling to get some sleep. I wasn't feeling any contractions, just a mild discomfort. I was given some GCSF, a hormone that stimulates stem cell growth, in the hope that my immune system would recover faster. Unfortunately, it causes bone pain. Feels like there's a large car parked on each of my bones. After an hour trying to get a doctors order, a nurse gave me some panadol and endone and I managed to sleep.I woke up at 5am to cramping and back pain. My mum and partner came in and kept me company. I sat around for a few hours until all of my consultants came in at the same time. They decided to try more prostoglandin gel. I was taken down to Birth Suit where I was given a stretch and sweep and more gel.It was decided that I needed a blood transfusion as my haemoglobin was about 85. Its supposed to be above 100. Thanks to chemo, my veins don't like to cooperate with cannulation. We finally found one on the inside of my left forearm for the transfusion. We also cannulated the back of my left hand in prep for cyntocin and fluids. Unfortunately, we couldnt cannulate, take blood from or blood pressure on my right arm thanks to a clot that had formed around a central line in it a few weeks previously. I had blood taken from my foot. A midwife decided that she didn't want to have to cannulate my foot if it came to that, so we went down to emergency to get an ultrasound on my arm. At this point, I was having mild contractions every 20mins or so. The sonographer informed us that the clot had resolved thanks to me being on blood thinners for weeks.I spent the next hour or two walking around in circles in the birthing suite, having to push my blood transfusion around on a very wobbly IV pump pole. I realised after a while that I was using too much energy just walking that short distance. I'd been struggling to just shower myself only several days earlier. All of my birth plans had gone completely out the window when I was diagnosed. I tried not to dwell on it and collapsed on the bed. The consultants where also concerned that the longer this took, the less energy I'd have. I was given an internal examination. The obstetrician told me that it seemed to her that my waters had already broken. She couldn't feel the membrane. I was a bit confused. I hadn't noticed my waters breaking. She said we could start the cyntocin, but if my waters hadn't broken, it wouldn't be a good idea.I asked for a second opinion. Another consultant gave me an internal and told me the waters hadn't broken. He dived right in with the crochet hook and broke them.Suddenly everything was happening at once. My transfusion had run out and a midwife was giving me another bag of blood. An anaesthetist came in and started preparing for the epidural. My oncologists came in to make sure things where going well and to give me another GCSF shot. Bone pain started to kick in again. Contractions where coming harder and faster.The anesthetist sat me on the end of the bed to try and give me the epidural between contractions. I had some gas to try and help me sit still.After testing the epi with a bolus of fentanyl, we discovered that it was only working on my left side. The anaesthetist suggested that i lie on my right side in the hope that the fentanyl would drop. He tried giving me more fentanyl. Suddenly, my left side was dead all the way up to my boob. I couldn't even move my leg. I could still feel everything on my right side! I could also still feel the cannula in my left arm throbbing from the blood transfusion.I was trying to sort of squat on the the end of the bed. The midwife was struggling to keep a trace on bubs heart rate though, so I ended up on my back again. I started getting chest pain. I figured it was probably the bone pain, but the midwife was concerned and brought an ecg in. Just as they where attaching the leads, bubs heart rate started to drop. An obstetrician ripped the leads off and put my legs up in stirrups. The room was suddenly full of people. I was told to start pushing. I could still only feel contractions on my right side. Bub was so tiny, I barely felt her. I pushed with each contraction, but they started to slow down. My cyntocin was increased, but it made no difference. My obstetrician decided I needed help and pulled out the forceps. They felt horrible going in, and i felt a clunk as they clamped around bubs head. I started to push again. I was running out of steam though. The forceps took a heap of skin off as bubs head was pulled out. I felt a little bit of pressure as I took a big breath and managed to push her shoulders out. I held my breath. No one said anything for a moment. I was terrified. Then I heard her squeal. The midwife pulled bub away from the neonatal nurse and put her on my stomach. She was wriggling and squeaking. The young midwife managed to keep the neonatal nurse away for a minute before she was swooped up. My partner bolted after her. She was taken to a nicu crib on the other side of the room. I listened to her screaming and just cried. Once they had her stable, they brought her around where I could see her. Her eyes where open and she had a beanie on. It was surreal. They took her out then. The room emptied. Only myself and the young midwife where left. I couldn't move. The midwife just left me there and sat down to fill out paperwork. My mum came back from NICU and told me that Ilona was doing well. My dad came in and gave me a hug. After a while I could finally move my leg again. I had lost a bit of blood, I felt very wobbly. My partner came back with a photo of Ilona. She was in an isolette, with a cpap strapped to her head.He helped me get up and shower. The midwife found me a wheelchair and pulled my cannulas. Seeing my baby attached to all the monitors was not easy. I was so relieved that she was perfectly healthy for a 32 week prem though. I'd had 4 rounds of chemo while I was pregnant, and countless other drugs to keep me alive. In the begining, no one could tell me how it would affect her. There had been no other cases of this type of chemo being used throughout the second trimester. She was only slightly below average weight. I'd had a few shots of betamethasone to try to mature her lungs. I'd had to miss one though while I was taking another type of steroid during chemo. Her lungs weren't quite ready. She didn't have enough surfectant. She spent 5 days on cpap. She also had apnea of prematurity. Her brain hadn't yet figured out how to breath regularly. I was told she was graduating to the Special Care Nursery the day I spiked a fever. A temperature is pretty scary when you are a cancer patient. I was admitted into hospital and immediately given the strongest antibiotic available. It took 5 days to discover that I had retained placenta. I was rushed off for an emergency D&amp;C. 20 minutes after I woke up from the general, I was back down in the nursery.We took Ilona home when she was 36 weeks, a month old. She truly amazes me.Ilona was fed donated human breast milk from day one, thanks to the brand new milk bank in the hospital. I managed to keep her solely on donor milk for 6 months before we had to start supplementing with formula. I even managed to breastfeed her for a little while. I had to wait until she was 4 months old and my body was not really up to re-lactating. Ilona is 11 months old now. I'm busy trying to plan her 1st birthday. I've been in remission since March, the recovery process will be a long one though. Chasing after a very active, bouncy, bubbly baby is both wonderful and exhausting.

c,"**Definitely go see a doctor.** Two years ago I herniated 2 discs in my cervical spine while I was getting into shoulder stand because I didn't properly set my weight. But it didn't happen right away, it took almost 3 weeks for the discs to fully herniate and when they did it was the most excruciating pain I had ever experienced (and at that point I had spent most of my teens and early 20s dealing with acute chronic back pain and muscle spasms). The first doctor I saw wanted to do surgery and I was ready to get on the table, I was in that much pain. Luckily my parents were the cooler heads (even though they freaked out when I told them I was going through with surgery to stop the pain) and were able to find a 2nd doctor on short notice who looked over my fMRI results and prescribed me a week's worth of steroids and PT for about a month and a half. My PT was great and went through my teacher training material with me so we could set up an at home sequence of poses I would do to help kinda squeeze the discs back into place. That and playing guitar and mandolin I'm convinced helped me recover as quickly as I did; the music helped gauge how fast I was recovering because the cervical spine is where the nerves to our fingers are connected to the brain and mine for my left hand were being impacted by my herniated discs. If it is a herniated disc, you'll want to get it taken care of asap because it can lead to nerve damage if left untreated. I still have a slight numbness in my left index finger and my forearm still gets sore where the discs impacted the nerves leading to that particular spot, but otherwise I'm fine. Don't let it go untreated OP, it could get worse. Don't feel bad that it happened either! The 2nd doctor I saw told me that between the ages of 18 and 90 the chances of having one or more discs herniate is the same; it can happen to anyone of us yogis if we're not mindful during our practice.",0.513714,0.655047,0.655018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2994652406417112

c,"Yoga? Swim therapy? Medicinal cocktails? Acupuncture? As inane as any of these suggestions sound, when it comes to back pain, and I'm in the same boat you are, don't give up and keep working til you find something that works for you. Yoga and easy back exercises that focus on pain and core strengthening are key for me. In the beginning, I was in too much pain, but eventually, I had more flexibility. Swim therapy was key. Swimming redistributes your center of gravity. You can move more freely in water. If you have access to a spa or a tub, this is like a body heating pad that loosens those stiff muscles and allows you to move freely. Certain medical centers offer spa/swim therapy classes that help you exercise with a shitty back. NSAIDS are nearly pointless and can do a number on your insides. Ask your doctor for some other mixes. I took Tramadol, and it's far from the best thing out there, but it worked for the time when I was in the most pain. Regardless of what the research says, Tramadol is habit-forming and it's best to take weaning doses when coming off. Acupuncture is worth a try. It doesn't hurt, it's relatively cheap and it helps alleviate some of the pain for weeks at a time. Dude, I bought everything from subscriptions to yogadownload.com and myyogaonline.com to heating massagers, pads and back belts meant for pregnant ladies. The best advice I can tell you is to research it and gain insight into the exact causes of specific pains, because more often than not, it's a satellite pain from a compressed nerve.

I think as they wore in and I was having nerve issues I failed to tighten the straps to accommodate for the natural stretching.  Do the lumps and bumps come from too much foot movement in the shoe?

s,"This is an update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ezz5qw/my_29m_girlfriend_28f_of_5_years_emotionally/), which was removed from this sub. I made a new account to comply with the rules. I’m going to leave a comment with my old account below to verify that this update is real.I broke up with ""Rat Girl"", as some of you nicknamed her. I called her mom to make sure she was close to her (since she’s suicidal) and sent a short message. For a while I was thinking of reconciling, but then I realized the whole truth about her.In my previous post, I was still focused on ""Rat Boy"". He was manipulative, a psycho, etc. It’s all true, but it’s not all. I was in denial about Rat Girl’s participation in the whole thing. It’s like there were two of her: my girlfriend and Rat Girl, and they weren’t the same person to me. I didn’t want them to be.My girlfriend was sweet, kind and loyal. Rat Girl was manipulative, selfish and disrespectful. Which one was real? Both, I guess, in their own moments. But I looked for my girlfriend and I couldn’t find her anymore. There was just Rat Girl.The thing that opened my eyes was seeing his latest messages to her. I had asked her to go no contact with him, but not block him – just ghost him. This was so I could read his new messages – which I knew he would send, because crazy people hate losing control – and gain new information.His messages were, as expected, manipulative and crazy. He even sent an audio crying. He reminded her of the nice things she had done for him. They had to keep seeing each other. He wanted to give her space, but he couldn’t bear not talking to her. He was suffering so much. He never meant to hurt her.While he attempted to manipulate his way back into her life, I maintained some contact with Rat Girl. I showed some vulnerability by sending her a few songs, and that’s when she pounced. She reminded me of the nice things I had done for her – we had to keep seeing each other. She wanted to give me space, but couldn’t bear not talking to me. She was suffering so much. She never meant to hurt me. This was my eureka moment. I could see clearly: I was being emotionally manipulated.From that realization on, I ignored her for a week while I collected myself. I read a few books which helped me:* **Leave a Cheater, Gain a Life:** This book is the kick in the butt you need to leave a cheating SO. It perfectly explains why cheaters cheat and what to do about it (leave), but it doesn’t tell you what to do next.* **Now What? A Guide for Men Starting Over in Life After Infidelity, Breakup and Divorce:** This book motivates you to work on yourself and take care of your body and mind, and to avoid dating for a while after a breakup. It’s good for short-term action and superficial self-improvement.* **Whole Again:** This is the real deal. It’s about self-love, why some people don’t have it and why they seek dysfunctional love in relationships. It promotes mindfulness as a path to long-term healing.So then I realized a few things about myself. I’m a people pleaser, codependent, a caretaker and I help people who can’t be helped in order to avoid my own core issues. I’ve had chronic back pain for years from bottled up emotions. A lot of these emotions have been coming out recently. My therapist said Rat Girl is probably BPD. My ex was BPD too. I already knew about BPD when I ended my previous relationship. I should’ve known. I feel dumb for falling for the same trap again. Untreated BPDs are emotional vampires and that's how my previous relationships went. I don’t want to keep doing that.I’m going to spend some time alone and working on myself and my projects. I’m not going to date anyone for a while. I’ll focus on cultivating my friendships and making new, healthy friends. I’m going on a cool day trip this weekend to see nature. I’m also planning on going to a yoga class. I don’t know how Rat Girl and Rat Boy are doing. I wish I could say I don’t care, but I still don’t want them to end up together. But there’s nothing I can do about it now, so I’ll have to learn to let that go and focus on myself and my happiness.As for the psychiatrist who was discussing Rat Girl’s case with Rat Boy, I’ll leave it up to her to do something about it, if she wants to. I’m not the harmed party in that, she is. So it’s not up to me to seek justice.Thanks everyone!**TL;DR:** I broke up with her.",0.607396,0.577309,0.534173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19777503090234858

c,"First, that sucks dude.  I'm assuming it was injection to treat chronic back pain that was already there.  Good news is that it will improve over time, but slowly. Second, I am also a member of the chronic back pain club.  I have had a couple of fractures and four herniated discs (two lumbar and two cervical).  I am in daily pain, because that's what happens when you have that much damage, but it isn't that bad and hasn't been for the past three years!  I'd say an average of 2/10 with an episode of 'throwing my back out' every 3 months. My secret:  I run four times a week and lift weights five days a week.  I run for less than thirty minutes each day and at a comfortable pace (i'm not competing for anything).  I do free weights and power lifting, focusing on full-body and compound movements.  I avoid injury by not pushing myself and gradually increasing the intensity of my workouts over the course of weeks and by getting instruction from a competitive power lifting friend on proper form before starting. I'm not saying mine is the only right answer, but I do know that avoiding activity and exercise because of pain is not beneficial.  I tried that for the first 5-6 years since my initial injury an my pain and disability were much worse.  ",0.538493,0.658517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30701754385964913
c,"1. First off, I'm not a doctor, and this is not meant to be taken as medical or legal advice. Your depression will not qualify you, unfortunately. Your back pain might. Chronic Pain is a qualifying condition in WA. You pay $150 for your initial recommendation. You don't pay if you don't qualify (usually), so the recommending doctor only needs to establish that they are protected if the recommendation is questioned. As long as you can reasonably meet one of the qualifying conditions, you shouldn't have any problem. It's not a difficult or trying process, in fact you'll be surprised at how quick it is. If you can get any records from your current doctor now, before you leave, that discuss your back pain or show a history of treatments for it, that will make everything much easier for you. 2. I'm not 100% sure, but I don't believe being a WA State resident is a requirement for an authorization here. As long as you have your passport or some other valid photo ID, you should be good. Again, I'm not totally confident about this answer, so double check. 3. The new law puts the DUI level at 5 nm/ml of activated THC. This is different than the typical 30-day urine test, and will generally only show positive if you've smoked in the past 4-6 hours. However, you can't just be randomly tested, there has to be probable cause. Possession and smell are specifically NOT probable cause. Obviously don't drive when you're not sober enough to, but you don't have to worry about having weed in your car. A packed pipe is a different story, of course. 4. No problem! I love introducing the Seattle area MMJ scene to people. 5. There is no one official document template or form. The authorization has to be on ""tamper resistant paper"", but other than that, it's just something saying that you have a doctor who believes you would benefit from the use of medical cannabis. So don't be surprised if your authorization looks different from someone else's. On a similar note, carry your authorization in your wallet, or somewhere that will stay with you. If you get a copy, keep it at home. If you plan to grow or have someone grow for you (which is an option), they'll need a copy on the wall of the grow area (along with a copy of photo ID). 6. There shouldn't be any suspicion, but it might take longer to get documents from further away. Like I said above, if you can get any of these documents now, you'll be saving yourself and your recommending doctor time, and lower the chance of a delay in getting your authorization. EDIT: Oh, and your Primary Doc's office will receive a request for your records from a doctor's office out here. It shouldn't specify why, and it will be accompanied by a release of information form signed by you. I personally qualify due to back pain as well. I've tried opiates, but I don't like their side effects. I do stretches and exercises for it, but it's still a daily pain. I explained as much to my recommending doctor, he agreed that cannabis could help, and made sure I had some safety information. I was only in the office for about 20 minutes, and walked out with a temporary authorization. My official one arrived in the mail about a week later. Authorizations are usually about $150 for your first time, then $75-100 for each yearly renewal. While the law does not require renewals, the recommending doctors will not verify you without a current authorization, which is one (reasonable) way they keep business coming to them.",0.0,0.536553,0.90204,0.766014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23300970873786409

s,"Hi board,I've been struggling with back pain for awhile, and made a GoFundMe page to help pay for treatment at a pain management clinic.  The page has been doing pretty well.  On the page, I wrote that I had asked my parents for help paying for the medical bill from the pain clinic, but that they had said they wouldn't help.  I put that there to prevent people from asking ""Have you tried asking your parents first?"", as some people had previously asked.Last night, I sent a message to a friend on Facebook, telling him about my page.  He's someone who I was friends with in school, but haven't seen since high school.  Not a great friend who I hung out with, but someone who I had some classes with.At first, the friend said ""If you need money, feel free to ask brother"".  Most people aren't that willing to give money. I felt so relieved.  I thought he was really going to help.Then he looked at my GoFundMe page and saw the part describing that I had tried asking my parents for help paying the medical bill at the pain clinic. Everything changed.He told me that he didn't want to be an enabler.  That my parents were good people, and he was sure that they had my best interest at heart.  He was concerned that I would use the funds to buy ""drugs"".  He wanted to speak to my parents by phone.  He wanted to speak to my doctor by phone.  All because I said that my parents wouldn't help me.  I immediately became a drug-using con-artist in his mind.I was devastated.  I said that I wouldn't feel comfortable with him speaking to my parents.  I said that speaking to doctors requires a release of information.  And lastly, I had posted all of my appointment information and receipts for the treatment on the page, so he could very everything that I said.  He stopped replying.I've since deleted the part about my parents from the page.  I doubt I'll hear back from that friend.They infect everything.  They corrupt everything.

I have been toying a little bit around with various exercises, and have decided to let some of the more exotic exercises rest for the time being. Also because I managed to mess myself up (lower back) in the process.   I did various rope climbs for the first weeks, but dropped it since I felt it might be too much too soon  i.e.  one arm negatives. Also it was hard to figure out if I were progressing in the exercise.  I want to do a ring routine sometime in the future. My current goals, upper body:* Muscle ups* Handstand push ups* Front LeverLonger term goals, upper body:Ring routine, One arm chin ups, The crossI am not particularly interested in the statics. Rather I want to gain dynamic strength, however, I wonder if I should incorporate some static elements. Particularly, with regards to the ring work later on. Also in OG the back lever is listed as pre-requisite for crosses (and probably for OAC too). I have held a 30s back lever in the past before a shoulder injury, though.

My question is along these lines: deadlifting or squatting? I read the Gray Cook article on deadlifting, also I personally prefer deadlifting (PB: 200kg, pre-injury) over squatting.

s,"I think it would be neat to see what you guys have found to be effective for certain ailments/overall well being. I'll start.Shilajit - By far the most expensive supplement I use ($60 USD for 10g). I tried it after reading about it just to see, and as an unexpected surprise, it took a way my back pain. It's packed with minerals. It's harvested from high altitude mountains (it seeps from cracks), but we don't really know what it is. Read into it, people claim it cures everything.Colloidal Silver - Kills infections. It works, and works well. It does have to make contact to work (inhaled for lung infections, applied to infected wounds, etc), so it has it's limitations, but it works very well. I wouldn't recommend drinking mass quantities though.Fish oil - Mood support among other known benefits. Krill oil is great too, but more pricy.Vitamin D3 - A good supplement for winter (or any time if you don't get any sun). You should take it with K2, and don't overdo it.Kombucha/Kefir - Excellent probiotics, and very easy and cheap to keep producing right at home. I prefer water kefir, as I'm not a milk fan.L-Theanine/Ashwagandha - These two are great for anxiety. Ashwagandha goes particularly well with cannabis while L-theanine seems to take the high down a few notches (which is nice if you hit a 9 by accident and want to drop to a 6-7).That's some of mine, let's see what you guys have.

c,"I had problems with chronic UTI's too, even when I wasn't having sex. First: Always make sure you are hydrating! Peeing flushes out the bacteria that's lurking, so peeing frequently helps keep it in check.  Second: Certain things can make UTI's more likely. For example, coffee is an irritant for the urethra AND dehydrates you. When I quit drinking it my UTI frequency went way down.  Third: Kind of embarrassing, but make sure you wipe front to back when you use the bathroom. NOT back to front! If you go back to front you're dragging all the bacteria from your butt right to your urethra.  Fourth: Pee before AND after sex. Even if it's just a little dribble. Sex pushes the bacteria up into the urethra. Peeing before clears out bacteria at the entrance, and peeing after clears out new bacteria. After is more important than before, but ideally you should do both. Fifth: Cranberry juice has some quality that helps prevent/kill a UTI, but be careful with it. It's also a diuretic, which means it will ultimately dehydrate you. Try cranberry pills and lots of water instead. Also, taking cranberry pills regularly can really help (I take 2 every morning, or 2 with every meal when I'm traveling or something) Last: make sure you do everything you can to fix it when you have symptoms. Chug water like crazy, take the over the counter stuff, keep clean. If symptoms stay for more than a couple hours, go to the doctor or a minute-clinic. In my experience, each UTI I've had has had exponentially worse symptoms. I used to just have the weird ""I still have to pee"" feeling, but now when I get one it goes from ""I feel a twinge"" straight to burning agony in under an hour.  Also, keep in mind that a UTI, if left untreated, can eventually travel up to your kidneys and do major, permanent damage. If you have a UTI and start feeling feverish and/or have lower back pain, GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM! Hope this helps! UTIs are the worst.

I (F17) am pretty. I like to think that I'm not arrogant about it, but puberty hit me like a fucking truck. I have a body like Jessica Rabbit, a face like a model, and a voice that legit got some Karens trying to get me banned from public speaking after I was Lady Macbeth because 'I caused inappropriate feelings in the men in the audience'. It's caused me some annoyance, but I'm definitely not about to complain about being pretty. Anyway, a couple days ago, my mother sat me down and explained that my little sisters (12F, twins) were getting to the age where they'd be insecure about their looks, that there was a lot of peer pressure and a bad messages in media, which I understand and agree with. Then she presented a list of things she wants me to do, since the terror is still going on and I'm going to be home with them longer than usual with Zoom school. Some things are fine, I don't wear makeup that often anyway, and the majority of my wardrobe isn't designed to flaunt myself.  But then there were some other things. Like, she wants me to start lying, complaining about my breasts causing back pain and how I can't get any good jobs because nobody takes me seriously. Which...I don't have back pain and I'm actually getting some good offers from legitimate art schools for acting so...no? And then she started talking about how maybe I could exercise less and eat less healthy, get a bit of a stomach. When I said no, because I like my body and I'm not about to sabotage my health, my mom snapped that she was trying to teach my sisters to be comfortable in their own skins and it was really hard to convince them that Barbie isn't actually what they should look like when I look like a living Barbie.  I told her I wasn't going to do it and to please leave me alone, but this morning one of my sisters woke me up by sneaking into my room, staring at me, then shouting ""I told you she wakes up looking like that!"" and running into her room, where she still is and refuses to talk to me. And now I feel like a bitch. Am I the asshole for not trying to look less pretty to help my sisters? *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

c,"OK.  ***proffers small sherry*** Part 1:  I went ski-ing in [Zermatt](http://www.ski-zermatt.com/winter.html) with the in-laws.

One day, I am playing rough and tumble (as best I can, very limited) with my nasty three y/o son in our living room when a song by Snow Patrol comes up on ***shuffle*** (see what I did there?) on the house-hold Powerbook G4. The wife comes out of the kitchen and says ""hon, can you check out that? It fucking plays ""Snow Patrol"" all the time and it's driving me crazy. Love you."" Part 2: I am a 21st Century man.

The problem (in retrospect, and I add this on the off-chance that you might actually care about this bit. In fact skip this bit if you're not interested) was 80% of the playlist selected was Snow Patrol by an apparent lack of attention to detail by the person setting it up. Part 3: At this moment, I was lying with the laptop before me, tummy-down on the ***hardwood*** floor, both elbows supporting me, back gently arched... when... without a shred of notice, the afore-mentioned 3 y/o BOY, who had no instructions relayed to him that the 'Ben-10 game' was over, and who had climbed like a ninja up onto the side of the couch, launched himself into the air, two-knees first, to land right into the lower/middle section of my prostrate back. Without mercy. Part 4: ***KRAAAAACK***  Part 5: That's what I heard in my ears. For a moment I lay there, waiting for the pain. But, instead, I swear to God, the sweetest sensation of relief and light radiated from my hips, all the way up my torso and into my tiny little brain. I couldn't speak. I stood. I walked into the kitchen. I got my wife's attention wordlessly. And, once I knew she was watching, I simply bent down and touched my toes with my fingertips.  It was amazing.

I'm only now starting to actually get to the root of the problem through my own personal research (I have anterior pelvic tilt, a sign of tight hip flexors which are causing me to have excessive lumbar flexion which causes lower back pain.

Here's a trick though: Pick up a big bag of Magnesium Chloride flakes (which is regularly sold as ice melt for your driveway) and use that in place of Magnesium Chloride (which is regularly sold as Epsom Salt). For some reason the Magnesium (which is the mineral you really want) in Magnesium Chloride is much more readily absorbable by the body than the same in Magnesium Chloride.  Bonus, you can buy a 50 lb. bag of Magnesium Chloride for about the same price as a 3 lb. bag of Epsom Salt. If you go this route just make sure you're buying ice melt that is actually Magnesium Chloride and not  Calcium Chloride or Potassium Chloride which are also sold as ice melt.     I've been having a lot of luck lately with cold water submersion as a means of recovering from BJJ practice.  From everything I've read it has the greatest benefit if you soak 2 hours after training.  So I leave the gym, get home, take a quick shower, eat some dinner, stretch a little bit, then soak in 65 F water for 10 or 15 minutes and then get in the Jacuzzi for a half hour or so or take an ""Epsom Salt"" bath (as above). Once you're over this acute bout of pain and the muscles are no longer in spasm I agree that yoga is of enormous benefit.  I do yoga 2x a week. Also core stability is huge: crunches and bridges, bridges and crunches, rinse and repeat.  But learn how to do them ""properly"" from a PT.  There's really no ""wrong"" way to do them, but there are ways of maintaining tension in your abs and low back so that the ""right"" muscles are being used and the joints are not being compromised. Learn to swing a kettle bell.  Again, if you don't already know how don't just a watch a YouTube video and give it a shot.  You can really jack yourself up with an improper hip hinge so you at least want to have someone who knows how to swing help you with proper form until you're comfortable with it. I've been dealing with chronic back pain for over 20 years now and had a surgery at L2/3 &amp; 3/4 back in 2015.  I actually took up BJJ as a method for dealing with the pain. All of this stuff is part of my routine (much of it daily, some of it 2x or 3x a week).  Back pain is a son of a gun but it can be managed.  Good luck bro. As an afterthought - if you sit at a desk all day that is probably doing you more harm than anything else in for life.  If you can figure out a way to get behind a standing desk it could be a game changer for you. Afterthought #2 - Pick up a thin foam sleeping pad like you would use for camping or backpacking.

c,"&gt; Power analysis on single subject designs? That’s a new one to me. Not sure why. Everything is nested within *something* and has questions of external validity (if you run it in one country, does it generalize to another? If you run it in many countries in one decade, does it generalize to another decade? and so on). N=1 self-experiments are no different. They have some annoyances, like any within-subject longitudinal design (do you need a washout period? How important is it to model any temporal autocorrelation?), but they're not all that qualitatively or quantitatively different from running any experiment, and I'm puzzled why people think they are being so clever and insightful by writing such things off as 'personal n=1 anecdotal experiences'. (If that's the case, can we write off a regular within-subject experiments with 30 people as 'merely thirty personal n=1 anecdotal experiences'?) So, of course you can do power analysis. Why wouldn't you be able to? &gt; What’s the use of unblinded self-experimentation? It sounds like a clear recipe for experimenter bias. I like blinding because if you're doing randomization, adding blinding is often easy and it's nice to eliminate concerns about that. But I don't think blinding is as important as I used to think it is. We shouldn't overrate the placebo effect. The placebo effect is strongest when you don't have any protection against regression to the mean (irrelevant if you are formally randomizing and collecting 100% of your data), early on, on subjective measures where attitudes/demand/expectancy effects can come into play, and where said attitudes are strongest. Do you really need a *placebo* control if you are experimenting on terminal cancer patients and looking at all-cause mortality? No. It's hard to skew a rating of a dead body, and cancer doesn't care if you have a really positive attitude and really want a drug to work. (You need protection against regression to the mean and other things, but the placebo effect, not so much.) What you need placebos for are if you are, say, asking people if the back surgery helped their back pain or if people with fancy new drug-coated stents feel like they are more active or can walk easier... So perhaps surprisingly, I've found that it often doesn't seem to matter if you take the extra trouble to do blinding. What really kills all these claims is if you randomize and track data systematically for a long period of time for a well-powered analysis. That'll turn up a null for most things. It seems that reverse-confounding and selection bias in data and 'honeymoons' account for most of the fake effects that people talk about in QS. If something survives an unblinded randomized self-experiment, then blinding is a good next step; but most things won't. (Obviously, if 'experimenter bias' were all-powerful, I would simply get strong positive results every time I didn't use blinding. But I don't.) &gt; Lastly, since you don't seem to publish your posts, have you considered putting them on figshare or the like? Seems like a waste of effort to me.

I was feeling exceptionally tired, so I measured my temperature and it was 37.3 °C (99.2 F?).To sum it up, it never went away. Sometimes it spikes up to 37.8, sometimes it goes down do 37.1 and never lower than that. Not my temp at all, I'm usually very cold and won't go over 36.2. First thing I thought: COVID. I waited a few days to watch out for other symptoms, got none, and off I went to take a swab test. Negative. Second thought, am I pregnant? I heard some people have some kind of spike in body temperature with pregnancy, so I took a test. Negative.After a few more days I call my doctor and tell him that I've been having a mild fever that won't go away. It's been a week and a half. I tell him that I'm covid negative and ask him to sign me up for some blood tests, since I had to get them anyway. I did them and all the values are ok, nothing out of the norm. He also made me test for some infective diseases such as toxoplasmosis, mononucleosis etc. Also no Covid. At least the big C word is out of the way, I guess.After seeing the blood tests (even if the inflammation values were very low) he made me go through a cycle of antibiotics. After 7 days, my fever was still there and just I was more miserable than before. He told me to suspend the antibiotics and told me to go to the hospital.I booked a visit with another doctor there, she visited me and told me I have no signs of anything in particular, apart from livedo reticularis and a mild Raynaud's.She suggested It may be some kind of vascular phenomena that makes my external temp spike up so she suggested measuring my internal temp too. He couldn't deny that it can be also something else so she signed me up for some other tests (one for self antibodies for example. she suggested it might be some form of connectivitis)I went home and measured both my temperatures more than once, and honestly they rarely matched the expected ratio. only once once or twice my internal temp was 1 °C higher than the external one.

It helps me sleep much better too, so I wake up feeling better than without it. Also, just makes me more aware of my body, so if a certain area is hurting more than usual I can address that further by stretching and/or myiofascial release therapy at home with a lacrosse ball and foam roller.",0.0,0.664453,0.0,0.53373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375
s,"Do you know why lumbar support is important for your desk setup and how to pick one? Have you considered the long-term impact on your back?I searched through dozens of lumbar supports on Amazon as well as other dark corners of the internet…and the vast majority of them are not optimal for your back if you're working from home all day.The primary issue? Memory foam. Memory foam was originally created by NASA for astronauts. NASA couldn’t afford to constantly be custom-fitting seats for optimal shock absorption.So, they created an ultra soft and plush foam that has the ability to change greatly in response to pressure.. Memory foam also “springs back” to its original shape more slowly due to its microscopic structure (hence, the term “memory” foam: it briefly remembers the shape it takes when pressure is applied).This made it a very effective shock absorption material and helped NASA increase the likelihood of astronauts surviving crashes or hard landings. Now, memory foam is used in many consumer products: seat cushions, mattresses (most notably, the Tempurpedic), and lumbar supports. But, it wasn’t originally created for these uses and it certainly wasn’t developed with your back health in mind. Memory foam certainly has benefits: it is very soft and can evenly distribute weight well. Thus, it can feel like more of a custom-fit. But, the primary benefits of memory foam can become a critical problem: it’s just too soft. Of course, a little memory foam may provide some pressure point relief and can be fine for your back. But, back supports made entirely or primarily from memory foam are going to give you issues.In the words of my mother (physical therapist)*“Memory foam is almost worthless because it just shrinks when your back puts pressure on it.”*Side note: memory foam also tends to retain lots of heat. This also makes it rather uncomfortable in a mattress, chair, or lumbar support. **Therefore, you need a lumbar support that is both firm and not made with memory foam.**Here are a few other very important factors to consider when selecting a lumbar support:**1.** **What’s your unique spinal curvature?**It’s like this: let’s say you place about 100 lbs of normal body pressure placed on your spinal discs when you are standing properly.If you are sitting poorly, that pressure could increase to more than 200 lbs of stress on the lumbar discs.. So, the goal of a good lumbar support is to push your spine back to normal lumbar lordosis (i.e. proper spinal curvature).This in turn decreases the body pressure placed on your discs back to a more manageable level. However, every spine is different and the optimal spinal curvature in the lumbar spine varies from person to person.So, you need to stand with good posture to get a feel for your optimal curvature and then find a lumbar support that will keep your spine in a similar curvature while sitting.NOTE: there is such a thing as TOO MUCH lumbar support. It’s called hyperlordosis (i.e. excessive inward curvature of the lumbar spine). That’s not what you want.**2.** **The seat of the chair**If a chair is soft or tilted backwards, you probably shouldn’t use it. But, if you must use it, then you need an even firmer and/or thicker lumbar support.**3.** **Chair height**This factor is similar to the previous factor. If your seat doesn’t go to an optimal height and your knees are at the same level or higher than your hips, then you are going to need a very firm and/or thick lumbar support to maintain your optimal spinal curvature. This is because the pressure that your back will put against the backrest will be very high.**4. Backrest of the chair**The optimal thickness of the lumbar support is, in part, also determined by how thick the backrest is. Another way of thinking about it is like this: if the backrest of the chair is almost concave, then you are probably going to need a really thick lumbar support to supplement the chair’s standard support. On the flip side, you might not need an add-on lumbar support if the chair’s built-in lumbar support is very good.You can read the rest of the post [here](https://posturre.com/why-lumbar-support-is-important-and-how-to-pick-one/?&amp;utm_source=lumbar&amp;utm_campaign=reddit_post&amp;utm_content=desksetup) if I've helped you at all.

c,"Not trying to argue but there actually is a huge difference.  I had brand reps come in and had brand meetings all the time at my old store and they taught us so much.  Cheap shoes are almost never genuine leather which that in itself is worth spending extra money to get alone. IF they do happen to have a leather upper they almost rarely if ever have genuine leather lining. Again, this is a huge difference in itself worth paying the extra money to get.  Real leather shoes make it so your feet can breathe a lot easier it also helps with odour too if you ever get stinky shoes. Manmade leather doesnt breathe, its basically plastic that just collects sweat and odour.  Additionally so many different brands have their own technologies that vastly improve the shoe. Also things like arch support are not only more comfortable but better for your feet and health of your body. Cheap shoes are generally just flat with no attempt whatsoever at adding support to the shoe.  There are so many different ways that shoes can be made and not to mention where they are made. This all affects price.  Theres so many other things that go into a shoe that add to the price and durability and really do make it worth it.  Im not trying to change your mind, if you prefer to buy cheap shoes then by all means continue to buy cheap shoes. Just dont go around saying they is no difference  between quality because i assure you that there is.  Your feet are probably one of your most important things. Poor shoes can lead to poor posture, and hip and back pain etc. Shoes can make a huge difference. Your feet are important parts of your body, so please treat then with respect, you will regret it down the road when you develop health issues or need to spend 800$ on orthotics because you thought you could get away with cheap shoes with no arch support.

c,"I went into my 3rd trimester with the plan of I'll stick it out for as long as possible and if the pain gets too bad I'll get one, thinking my pain tolerance is high (having never been in a significant amount of pain before, that's foolish) Well..... At 40+5 at about 6am, I started contracting, went to the hospital twice to only be told I was 2 cm dialated. i was told by the midwife that if my doc admitted me and gave me the epidural at that point, I would be stuck in bed for the duration of labor. So I decided to go home. I labored at home from 3pm that day to 10am the next. I tried everything, showers, yoga ball, meditation, the pain was brutal. I did not sleep at at. When I got to my doctor the next day at 10am I was only 3cm, but she was able to ""make me 4"" and gave me a slip for an epidural at the hospital. After that everything was great.  I got there, they admitted me gave me the drugs and I felt great. I didnt feel a thing and was making jokes with the docs and nurses. I was able to sleep a few hours before my daughter was born at 11pm that night.  Thinking back it was kind if funny but the epidural made me itchy.

c,"Get another MRI. That will tell you the extent of the injury and give you insight on recovery time. I really feel you. My case is very similar to yours. Sciatica first hit me 10 years ago, flaring every 6 months but would settle. 3 months ago I had the usual flare up. Woke one morning to what was the beginning of the worst pain I've ever experienced. Stayed that way for a few weeks, same as you, so bad I felt like I was going to faint. So bad I lost appetite regularly and couldn't eat much. Sleep is a mess. New MRI revealed my L5S1 was bulging 10mm. Before this my sciatica was caused by the L4L5. Got a CT guided cortisone injection which brought the pain down considerably. My doctor put me on a suite of meds which, with the effects of the injection, enabled me to walk (averaging 60 minutes per day)... crucial for long term recovery. Also swimming 4 times a week. Meds that have been most effective for me has been diclofenac 100mg suppository (yup, pain so bad I now stick my finger in my butt hole daily to get relief). Doc also gave me a week of valium, which works as a had me relaxer and gave good relief. With all this I was able to start working again. However I am a freelancer, work from home, I only work standing up, sitting is the worst. I take a break every 20-30 minutes to do a laying stretch (details at end of this comment). Get the MRI, get this major flare up diagnosed ASAP. Ask your doctor about an injection. It doesn't work for everyone, but it worth trying. I am a desk worker like you. My hypothesis is that bad posture over a few years at the computer pushed this disc out. On YouTube look up Bob and Brad physical therapists. They have lots of good vids on how to manage pain. One east thing that might help... try laying on your stomach. Wait for about 30 seconds. If the pain doesn't get worse, put your fist under your chin to prop yourself up.

After that, I became a lot more able to stifle a sneeze. As soon as my back got a bit better, I was sneezing again.

s,"40 y/o male. Healthy, relatively fit, and active before last October. No major past health issues other than 2014-2015 several instances of unexplained pericarditis that hospitalized me. 2016 I got cytomegalovirus and it hit me hard and took 6 months to fully recover. For completeness sake I want to start in October 2019 but the craziness really hit in January of 2020October 2019 I was lifting a heavy log in the yard and blew up my L4 and L5. It was severe enough pain that I couldn’t walk or stand up without help. Was treated in ER with toradol injection, Percocet and Lidoderm. Went home with lidoderm and 8 weeks of physical therapy. At this point I have very little back pain and it’s not an issue for me (that I know of, at least). November 2019 I began to have a globus sensation when swallowing, right above the sternum. It waxed and waned but was very uncomfortable. Never impeded eating or drinking. Got endoscopy from GI looking for eosinophilic esophagitis. Esophagus was inflamed and ringed but biopsy results showed low eosinophils. GI recommended no dairy, soy, gluten or eggs for 6 weeks. Tried this with no major improvement. Globus is maybe 20% better but still comes and goes. January 2020 I was suddenly slammed with massive fatigue, malaise, out of the ordinary headaches, tinnitus, nausea and dizziness. Never any fever but cold feeling very often. This feeling went on for two weeks. The kind of fatigue where I was falling asleep talking to my boss in person, falling asleep playing with my daughter at 8 pm, and not being able to get up in the morning. Then on January 18 2020 I will never forget what happened. I woke up at 8 am and knew I couldn’t get up. I had my wife close the bedroom door and leave me alone to sleep. I then woke up at noon (not normal for me) and as I woke, I felt vibrations (rapid tremors) shoot from the back of my neck and shoulders down both arms, symmetrically. It took about 5 seconds to travel down and out my fingertips. It was extremely disconcerting. Chalked it up to not feeling well and didn’t dwell on it too much. Unfortunately, that was the beginning of my continuing torture. For two weeks after that, EVERY time I’d wake up and come out of sleep, the same vibration rapid tremor would travel down my arms. I grew to expect it. My fatigue and headaches and nausea lessened a bit, but the tinnitus stayed fully. Two weeks later my condition progressed and it began. To happen AS I was drifting off to sleep AND as I was waking up. Sleep sandwiched by creepy tremors. Then things went farther and for the first time I began being woken up in the night and felt the vibration tremors go down my arms. Once I’d wake myself up, they stopped. The next progression was once I was woken mid-sleep, the tremors went down my arms and then CONTINUED down my LEGS symmetrically. It exited my toes just like the arm tremors exited my finger tips. After that, the next progression was waking up mid sleep with the tremors hitting the back of my head, neck, and throat. In fact, when I got scared and woke my wife, my voice warbled from the vocal cord rapid tremors. I should point out that all of these tremors are internal, in that they can’t be seen. Particularly in the big leg muscles though, they can be felt. My wife woke once from my legs vibrating while up against her. At this point, my sleep depravation began due to the waking multiple times per night from the tremors. Fight to fall asleep through tremors. Sleep an hour or two. Wake with tremors. Fully wake myself up to stop them. Try to get back to sleep. Rinse and repeat over and over. Once this became a pattern, things progressed to where I am now. The night time hell continues, but now during the day, my calves are cramped very easily, my legs are tired and I don’t like waking or standing for long times. I have random muscle twitches and spasms in my thighs, calves, left forearm, throat, glutes, and even groin. Other notable things. My lips sometimes feel like they vibrate with the same high frequency low amplitude tremor. If I hold my teeth just barely not touching together, they will chatter at that same frequency. My tongue feels annoyed at times and I find it numb here and there, I think from pressing it up against my teeth. Over the past 4 days, my right middle toe goes numb for a while and then eventually gets ok again. Most mornings or in the middle of the night, I will get numb hand and fingers on one side. I have also had my whole upper left arm shoulder to elbow go dead numb. I shake things around and it comes back. One theory on the numb arms and hands are that I feel freezing cold at times during the night and I may be tucking my arms to my body for warmth and pinching nerves. Not sure. I also have my feet and sometimes one or both hands go ice cold. Through all of this, my tinnitus continues, periodic fatigue (keeping in mind I can’t sleep well), but headaches nausea and dizziness are gone. The vibrations come and go at rest during the day. Like my legs will vibrate sitting here typing for 3 minutes and then go away. All the meanwhile random muscles fire one-off. Still never a fever. Enter the doctors and tests:- primary care did basic neuro tests an ordered lots of bloodwork. CBC, metabolic, ANA/rheum stuff, thyroid. All were perfectly normal. - saw a neuro and he also did physical exam and listened to my story. He initially diagnosed me with partial seizures given the tremors and the massive “out of body” feeling fatigue. We tried Aptiom 400mg 1xday for a few days, but I called him on the fourth day after the night before I was up crying and moaning in such cramping leg pain and string tingling tremor vibrations all night. I couldn’t even have my wife touch my legs, they hurt so bad. He said to stop the Aptiom and now he was thinking some type of neuropathy, so start taking Cymbalta. He also ordered other bloodwork which all came back fine (antibody looking for myasthenia gravis and a CK test). He ordered a brain MRI with and without contrast (looking for MS or rumor). That came back fine. After my night in such pain, he saw me again and noticed my tongue twitching. He said he clinically did not believe I had ALS, but wanted to help put me at ease and ordered an EMG. The EMG doctor said that it was clean and no signature readings for neurodegenerative disorder like ALS and no myasthenia graves.  He did a short term (half hour) EEG that was also boring. My cramping pain and leg fatigue, and hell nights continued and  the Cymbalta was doing nothing except making me feel crazy, completely impotent, and beyond zero appetite. He then ordered a 48h long term EEG. I still do not have the results back from that. At this point, he told me he is nearing the end of his ideas of how to help me. He encouraged me to see a neuro at a top facility and said since I was in such pain, to go to Jefferson’s ER. I went there and saw the on call neuro (not a movement disorder sub specialist but naturally a brilliant doctor being part of Jefferson). He latched onto when I said “burning” pain in my legs at times and said Small Fiber Neuropathy. I didn’t want to argue with a top doctor but, to me, small fiber is numbness and pins and needles and tingling nerve pain in the toes and fingers and then it can back up from there. I don’t believe small fiber addresses nighttime resting tremors, vocal cord tremoring, cramping during the day, and large muscle random jolts. When I told him about the Cymbalta he said stop that and start gabapentin (I’m now on the maintenance dose of 300mg 3x a day). He did a lupus panel, creatine cinase (sp?) looking for rheumatoid arthritis and a couple other blood tests. All came back fine. He suggests that we now to a skin punch biopsy to look further at small fiber or something else. Like the first neuro, he said this is not presenting like ALS. Like many posts on here, it scares me still at times, even though multiple neuros are saying that. He was not receptive to the idea of a lumbar puncture to further investigate and look for things like CIDP. He said a spinal MRI could be nice but not critical. He agreed that a sleep study could be interesting as well. I told him I want some in lab sleep study that monitored my muscles and has me on video. I want them to document my hell. I am seeing a neurologist sleep specialist in April who will do some testing with me. Not sure if it’s what I’m hoping it will be. - rheumatologist had no thoughts and didn’t think it was a rheum issue. He did test me for iron and he came back on the low side. Odd since I eat meat and veggies a lot. No doctor will comment on why it was low and if it’s an issue. - GI doesn’t have any further thoughts. Did a barium swallow yesterday for the stupid Globus that won’t go away. No interesting findings from that. - my sleep / pulmonologist (I wear a CPAP) had no thoughts and said he’s taking a back seat with this issue. So I have a binder full of tests and doctor notes with no real help or answer. I continue to take the gabapentin. Not sure if it helps or not. My cramps have not been as brutal but they’re still there. I still tremor around night and have only slept through two nights in the last 2 months. I continue to have cramps and spasms during the day, and when I first wake up, the grip in my hands are weak. It comes back to being fine during the day. My theory is that my muscles are going nuts all night and that’s why my legs feel shot and cramp when I’m up and about, and why my arms feel weak until they can recover a bit. I am even staying out of my house now as an experiment for anything environmental. Wife and child aren’t impacted anyway, though, so likely not that. Like many of you in posts I came across, I spend hours per day scared, upset, worried and ultimately go down a rabbit hole of Googling, trying to help myself since the doctors aren’t much help yet. Naturally most googles lead to MS, ALS, PD and the usual suspects. There are days where I feel like my legs are dying and nights where I feel like I’m actually dying. I have found a few medical forum posts of people with the same symptoms of night tremors and day cramps but then they just disappear, which doesn’t help put me at ease at all. I specifically typed in fasciculations, cramping, vibrations at rest/sleeping, and I got hits on threads in this reddit BFS group. It gave me some hope that what I’m suffering with might be aligned with BFS. I have another neuro appointment tomorrow where I want to ask about pursuing the spinal mri, skin puncture, and sleep tests. Shame I still don’t have the 48h EEG back yet to discuss with him. Sorry for the long first post, but hopefully my detail is helpful in sparking some thoughts or helping others who have the same mess going on.

c,"That is one hell of a  dissertation.  Here is my own empirical evidence.   In the early months before Covid I had just finished what I thought would be my game room.  We had shopped around and had settled on two higher end game chairs.  To be precise, the SecretLabs chairs.  I also purchase two lower end models from a company named RapidX and two more Ikea office chairs that are highly recommended. Once Covid hit and my children moved back in from college and my wife had to close her business and we found everyone working from home, my game room turned back into a bedroom for my daughter and everyone found themselves working long hours in front of a computer. I had an office chair and the first thing I did was swap it for one of the higher end SecretLab chairs I had in the game room.  My wife took the other one.  Best move we made as I have zero back pain and I have a long history of back issues.   My son and daughter decided to use the RapidX chairs over the Ikea office chairs.  The only issue with the RapidX chairs were the castor wheels which were plastic and truly sucked!!  Beside scratching the floor they seemed to not be able carry an weight.   Based on several reviews online about the chairs, I ordered real castor wheels with nice non marring rubber and replaced the plastic casters for real steel quality castor wheels.   Everyone is now happy.  I have also used the RapidX chair myself when I was helping my daughter make PPE masks with our 3D printer.  It was also very good.   Nobody wants to use the Ikea chairs.  There is nothing wrong with them they are just not as adjustable or comfortable to use. The key for any chair is getting the right height and adjustment and if required getting a foot rest if required which we needed to do for my wife. For ANY chair, best way to determine what is best is to actually sit on the chair.   Purchase one or two and if they do not work out, sell them and repurchase something else. After all the many long hours I have sat on both my game chairs, I have no desire to go to a different chair and both kids have asked if they can keep the chairs they have when they move out again to go back to school or find a job or place of their own. There are many comfortable options I am sure including a past post where someone found some basic conference room chairs they said they liked.  Again, it is a matter of testing out the chairs to see how they will work for you. I agree with the lumbar support but also make sure everything else is also adjustable.  Arm, tilt, lumbar.  Some chairs come with a head rest pillow and we found them to be just as good as anything else you can do for your neck. That is my experience.  I am sure others will have their own.  I am sold on the gaming chairs.  When I see them on sale I will replace my two RapidX chairs that my kids will be taking with them some day when they move back out to go to school again.",0.599531,0.523815,0.0,0.565776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24372759856630824

Because I am currently unemployed due to being forced to quit my job I go with him to keep him company &amp; help out by grabbing him drinks or papers so that he can focus on work. I have been applying for jobs but have had difficulty calling employers back. I am allowed to set up in the conference room but I would have to leave immediately if their boss shows up &amp; continue my call outside in 110 degree or higher heat or hangup. The past 2 days I have stayed home because of an infection that I am fighting as well as an upset stomach &amp; back pain from having an old injury flare up. I often get infections and it takes me longer to heal. He seemed incredibly upset this morning once I told him that I wouldn't be joining him today. He informed me that he has to go into town today &amp; wouldn't have time to pick me up to join him beforehand &amp; that it would take him about 3hrs longer than normal to come home because of errands &amp; asked me if I still wanted to stay home. I felt bad but I chose to stay home. It is now 4hrs after his off time. He is the youngest in a family that cares about power &amp; status above all else. The brother that he works with now has severe anger issues &amp; choked him in his sleep when he was a child for breathing too loudly. He tells me now that this isn't something that his brother would do now. But his brother gets incredibly loud &amp; angry over things that shouldn't bother him &amp; I am sure that despite my husbands protests that his brother's behavior doesn't bother him it in fact does bother him. For the past 10yrs he &amp; I were living with his family. It started off as him giving me a place to stay with him &amp; his parents when my mother's 33 yr old husband attacked me an 18 yr old. About 3yrs later his oldest sister returned from out of state with more money than anyone else in the family &amp; suddenly everyone who gave her shit bowed to her in 1 form or another. She convinced her parents to leave their house that they had rented for over 10yrs to move into her rented house &amp; help her pay rent. He &amp; I chose to move out at this time &amp; she guilt tripped him into staying with her because how else will she make rent in time? A year later she bought a house &amp; turned the garage in her house into 2 rooms. I wanted to move out but my husband insisted on living in her garage as it would be far cheaper for us. Fast forward to this year &amp; she wants us out of her house immediately. She claims that she never needed our money &amp; kicked us out so he would hop state &amp; work with his brother. She went back &amp; forth on a promise to help us buy a new car after forcing my husband to go against me &amp; sell my car that he was part owner on. I had never left my home state until now &amp; this move was incredibly hard on both of us. Now he won't return my texts at all. AITA? *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I quickly realised I couldn't actually stand watching bands for ~2 hours at a time. I simply countered this by getting to the shows super early and getting up to the barrier. Had a lot of fun right up front of some utterly amazing bands but my word the back pain and severe lack of physical stamina. Walking would regularly leave me winded.**I should have acted!**&amp;nbsp;**2009**I stayed in this familiar pattern for a good six years by ignoring obvious warning signs - clothes getting tighter, being unfit and generally still eating utter garbage. In the spring though I got tickets to an amazing gig (AC/DC fyi!) and I went along with a friend. Even the short walk to the stadium from the parking area was too much for me and my friend hailed a cab. Finally we were allowed into the stadium and I ran into a problem right away:**I couldn't fit through the turnstile!**Mortified but the event staff accommodated my needs and I got to see the show. In agony and clinging onto the barrier for most of the show I really enjoyed myself but felt horrible after the show. To speed things up after the show my friend went to get the car and picked me up.&amp;nbsp;A month later and I went to my first festival. Whilst I enjoyed myself I stuck to my same strategies: find a barrier to lean on and sit down where ever possible. Due to some bad planning by the organisers those who paid for early entry (my group) got camped furthest away from the event. I didn't enjoy that walk either - lots of breaks and shortness of breath.**I should have acted!**&amp;nbsp;**2013**The same miserable cycle continued for the next few years and whilst my friends put up with my lack of fitness I felt like I was letting them down. By 2013 I went to yet another festival and had the worst time missing all of the headliners since I was just so tired all the time. I figured I just over done things during the day and didn't worry about it.**I should have acted!**&amp;nbsp;**2014 -2017**More of the same lifestyle but now incorporating some exercise (weight lifting, rowing) and some rudimentary knowledge of diet. Chocolate all the time, Christmas was just an excuse to inhale sweets and biscuits like it was going out of fashion and frequently injured - lifting weights when you're overweight hurts, who knew?!&amp;nbsp;I'd stopped attending gigs/festivals and more into shows at the theatre and wrestling. The latter involved lots of standing which I really struggled with and of course and loads of back pain. I'd started to make an effort with diet and exercise by this point but struggled on CICO and routinely failed. I also had no idea of my weight which didn't help.In 2015 I was finally diagnosed with sleep apnoea and my quality of life began to improve drastically which explained the tiredness at the festival 2 years earlier. Of course this lead to some improvement in diet but still not enough.**I should have acted**&amp;nbsp;**2018**Back to the current day and whilst I've flirted with low carb/keto in the past couple of years it's never really stuck. There's always been some problem I've never been able to solve so given up but hopefully I can find some answers here if that happens again.The last time I did keto was in January and had great results in as little as 5 days but mystery illness side tracked me and I jumped right back into the usual bad habits. Biscuits and chocolate is my kryptonite and causes me all sorts of problems.&amp;nbsp;**NOW I'M ACTING**&amp;nbsp;I'm genuinely fed up of the constant struggle now. I can barely walk around the supermarket I work in without being massively out of breath, I'm in pain a lot and I struggle to fit into the gap to enter the tills without knocking something over. Amongst other things my ankles are horribly swollen and only 3 pairs of socks I own actually fit and stay up all day. It's depressing and leads to a wonderful negative feedback loop and you know how that ends!Although it wasn't totally keto I made a fresh start yesterday (2018/10/02 - /r/ISO8601 y'all!) and intend to stick with it. I have some support from my parents who are sceptical since they are life long CICO aficionados - as far as they know I'm eating low carb, not keto (Rule 1?)&amp;nbsp;I finally managed to find some scales that can weigh me (huge boost) and I have a starting number: **588.8lbs**. I'm a goddamn monster. A loveable, nerdy monster but still. The only way is ~~up~~ down, right?&amp;nbsp;**NOW I'M FINALLY ACTING!**",0.590721,0.646861,0.601945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18102613746369797

s,"Hey all, not looking for a diagnosis here, just some advice on what to tell doctors, if others have had experiences like this, and if there's anything I can do in the meantime.I've been on T since May 2014, and in early 2016 my dose (30mg subq/weekly) started to fluctuate because of a mix of mental health issues and the accessibility of hormones. I was missing a week or two at least every couple months. This got a little better in 2018, I was only missing a week once every couple months, never two weeks in a row. In January this year my does completely stabilized again, I haven't missed a week since.In February I got my period for the first time since September in 2014 and it was beyond painful like twice as painful as my periods were before, but fairly light. The next month my period was super heavy and even more painful, and it's continued like that, every single month. Honestly, my periods now are more regular and predictable pain/flow wise than before I started T.When I say pain, I mean I was waking up screaming regularly and couldn't move throughout most of the day in the week leading up to and during my period. There were cramps/burning/stabbing pain in the uterine/ovarian area, vaginal cramping and soreness, back pain, and anal cramping. I've had spinal fusion surgery so my metric for pain is pretty big, and this was hitting a 6 at the best and a 8 at the worst. About two months ago my GP increased my dose to 40mg/weekly, and the next week when my period started the pain was so bad I went to the trans clinic walk in and the nurse immediately increased me to 50mg where I'm at now. Apparently my levels were at rock bottom even though my dose had been steady for almost a year. Last month I got a period again and it had become so bad that I went to the clinic again to see if they could do anything and I was given an ultrasound appointment to see if there was any atrophy or an ovarian cyst, but it was for November. I was offered a birth control shot (depo provera) but turned it down because of some side effects I knew would tank my mental health, which is one of the things that made my dose unstable in the first place. At the end of September the pain was so bad I went back and got the depo shot. None of the doctors or trans care nurses at the clinic are sure why my period is still happening, I've noticed that just in the last couple months at the higher dose that I've had a bunch of T effects (jaw squaring out again, facial hair thicker than it's ever been, muscle growth, voice dropping, etc.) so the T is working in other ways. The bleeding completely stopped, but the cramping and pain only went away for a couple days before it came back with a vengeance. 7 at the lowest, 9.5 at the highest, I couldn't eat or sleep for a couple days. Since then, regardless of whether or not I've been bleeding or where I'm at in my cycle, the pain has been coming and going every few hours.I went back to the clinic last week when they re-opened and they ran a bunch of tests. T levels, every std under the sun through bloodwork and urine samples, UTI/kidney infections, acute inflammation, white blood cell count (for appendicitis I think?), a pelvic exam with swabs, and an abdominal exam. They gave me a list of symptoms to go to the er for and sent me home, then contacted me last Friday to let me know that everything came back negative. They said it couldI ended up in the ER two nights ago because I had a handful of the symptoms they warned me about. I had a low fever, was easily fatigued, the pain was getting worse and had stopped responding to painkillers (tylenol, advil, naproxen, cannabis, all of which I was taking regularly and according to the instructions to help with the pain for a while), and I was really dizzy and disoriented. Except for the fever, all of these are still happening. I have shooting pain/cramping in my vagina and anus, and the cramping in my uterus and lower back are making the rest of my back/neck and arms seize up. I've almost collapsed and can't walk very far.They ran blood tests, a urine sample, and did an abdominal and pelvic exam. I was too out of it to ask for my results or what they were testing for. This time the pelvic exam HURT. The last time it was a little uncomfortable, but this time I was flinching and couldn't keep quiet, even the swabs hurt and the doctor seemed concerned. They got me a sooner ultrasound appointment, gave me some antibiotics (flagyl, doxycyclin) and sent me home.I'm typing this up because the pain just keeps getting worse. I'm shaky and crying more often than not, and I'm sick of it.Has anyone had symptoms like these, and if you have was it/how was it resolved? Do you have any recommendations for pain management between now and my ultrasound in a week?",0.0,0.715386,0.699085,0.581413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17885264341957255
s,"Summary: visited a chiro for the first time today, it was such an odd experience for me that I did research after the fact and noticed there is a *lot* of different sites that paint the practice in a bad light. So I want to hear more opinions from practitioners and participants. How effective is chiropractic medicine?Long version: For the past week I've dealt with a pain on my lower left side, with all the markers that would point to the sciatica nerve (just a self diagnosis so take that with a grain of salt). Listed among treatment options was seeing a chiropractor so I decided to give it a try. After a quick examination he told me that my hips were tilted, giving me an inch difference between my legs. The adjustment process was quick but I found it super wierd to be rolled and popped. After the first round he looked at my legs, said they were still off and went in for a second push on my hip, I was still off a little even after that but I was told it's normal for the body to resist being corrected. He also made further adjustments up my spine and on my neck even though I hadn't complained about pain that high. It was recommended to me to me that I come in several times a week for the first month. It's not covered by my insurance so I only made an appointment for the following week.  It wasn't bad, but the experience was wierd enough to me that I did more research when I got home. Search terms like ""is chiropractic effective?"" Got me a lot of sites that basically called it ill researched pseudo sience. My visit wasn't ""spiritual"" and my chiro didn't talk about adjustments as a cure-all. I hadn't realized it was considerd an alternative form of medicine until my research so I read page after page trying to understand it better. There was so much bad press on the field I'm not sure I want to go back next week. However, I do like to get a well rounded opinion so I figured reddit might be able to balance my viewpoint",0.0,0.589475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.296195652173913

s,"I'm a younger guy, used to be in great shape in high school when I was involved in athletics, but since then I've unfortunately not treated my body very well.

I'm on my feet all day for work and find that I'm constantly fighting my body to try to keep decent posture. I am, however, still fairly mindful in understanding what my body is telling me, and what I've come to realize is that tight hips are a major factor in my entire situation right now.I'm breathing from the upper chest too much, letting my butt stick out because I'm not utilizing my lower abdominal muscles to connect my upper and lower halves, and letting my knees and lower back pick up the strain. Basically, I'm looking to start a yoga routine to pull myself back together. I don't have the resources to go to classes, so I'm looking to do a home routine. My only worry is that my tight hips could lead to establishing bad practice., and I'm just wondering if that's something I should really be worried about, if there is some preemptive training I should do to remedy this before starting a yoga routine, or if I should just jump in and the routine will clear things up.So TL;DR, I have very tight hips/bad knees and am wondering if I should just jump into yoga to try to help with this, or if there's something else I should do first to make sure I don't damage myself further with bad practice.

s,"27f, 5’0”, ~110 lbs. no previous issues. Born w/ hydrocephalus, right VP shunt placed at 5 weeks, sometimes have issues w/ tubing pain due to this issue.Some backstory - I’ve had chronic back pain for years. Decided to start stretching to help alleviate my tight back muscles in February. Felt them release one by one over the course of a few weeks, was feeling amazing, and then one night in early March went on a walk and within 20 minutes my spine was burning and tingling and my limbs were going numb. Got driven home by my roommate and was bedridden for days. Went to see my pcp and she said she couldn’t feel anything wrong, but recommended a CT scan because of my shunt. Got that done and they said nothing was out of the ordinary and claimed it was probably a muscle spasm.A couple weeks later I went through another episode like the walk, except I got a horrific rushing in my ears like a train was coming and my vision started going black. I have tinnitus, but this sounded completely different. I asked my roommate to take me to the hospital because I was terrified, and tried to get to the front door. Ended up blacking out in the living room feet away from the door. My roommate called an ambulance and when they arrived, I (sort of) came to, they seemed to think nothing was wrong and kept asking me if I was on drugs. (I was not. Just hysterical, for what I think are pretty okay reasons?) told them it was my ribcage and that it felt like it was in chunks, and pieces were sliding underneath one another. I asked them to feel my ribcage. One of the EMTs lightly tapped me in two different places and told me I was fine. Lol. I told them to leave my house and had my roommate drive me to the hospital. She had to nearly carry me to the car. The EMTs watched me collapse 3 times on the way out. Haha. (I’m in the US. Can you tell?)The hospital was very similar. The ER doctor did feel a little bit more liberally, but she also told me nothing was out of place. She said she could physically feel the muscle spasm, and that that’s what she thought it was. Had yet another CT scan, and they once again told me nothing was wrong or out of place. I felt myself and asked her to feel a little higher, where I could feel what I *believe* was a rib slipping underneath another rib. She told me that it was normal for muscle spasms to knock bones out of place. (But had told me that nothing... was out of place... like 10-15 minutes previously.) I ended up losing my job because I was unable to sit up straight for hours on end without my limbs going numb and getting a sharp pain down  my spine. Because my doctors kept telling me nothing was wrong, I wasn’t able to convince my job to keep me, and also with that, I was ineligible for unemployment, so I have been completely screwed financially and have no money left to see a doctor. I have no idea what’s wrong and I’m scared, and I haven’t been able to work at all because of this. Sometimes it feels like my lower ribs are stabbing my skin. Sometimes it feels like I’m an armadillo with plates folding up into one another, instead of one solid piece of ribcage.  I’ve been treating it mildly as slipped rib syndrome because that’s all I can find that relatively fits what on earth is happening to me, and sometimes I can get my right side... realigned, I suppose would be the proper way to put it? Where there are no ribs sliding under one another, but it’s very hard to keep them that way, and sometimes if Im not careful I will clip my tubing between ribs and holy crap, is that horrifically painful... And I can’t seem to get my left side to do that at all, unless I lift my left arm, place my hand on the back of my head, and press my elbow back - but again, that’s not really something I can do long term, and it’s extremely strenuous to just hold that position.It’s extremely painful, but only when things get stuck in strange places. I might just be used to it, but really the only long term effects are the numbness, spine pain I’ve just learned to deal with, and all of my muscles hurt, probably from holding things in the wrong places - and I’ve had 2 other “episodes” with blacking out since the hospital, but I always wake up and seem to just... recover, I guess? Please help me. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do. At this point I’m kind of just resigned to living like this, but I literally can’t live like this. I’m running out of money and idk how I’m going to pay rent next week. Idk how to help myself and I don’t have many options.",0.53079,0.606239,0.819261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875

s,"Been a lurker for a few weeks, unfortunately. Ive been experiencing burning pain on the left side of my face since the end of july. I think it was precipitated by a long term chronic pain issue that first happened at the beginning of 2018 when i sprained my trapezius working in a factory setting (poor ergonomics, long hours, no exercise). It turned into a neck and right shoulder pain issue where i was bounced around from physio, to different doctors, getting imaging done since i thought it was rotator cuff related (x ray, mri of cervical spine, ultrasound) and all the while experiencing allydonia and nerve pain down my arms. Even developing some sort of sciatica down my right leg which i still deal with.Right shoulder pain turned into left shoulder pain, my Dr saying my nerve pain is related to my central nervous system becoming sensitized to the pain. Great. I left my full time job for a part time one, fast forward to the end of this past july when i experienced a shooting nerve sensation going from the top of my neck to the bottom of my jaw, left side of my face. It freaked me out and soon enough a burning crawling sensation followed the path of the trigeminal nerves on that side of my face the rest of the night. It scared me. The next two months i would have random flares, mostly if i worked at night, but could usually sleep it off, so i didnt tell anyone about it except my bf.I think it must have been precipitated by stress, as i was suppose to make an important job related decision that day that was bothering me.After that first attack i had a specialist appointment about my shoulder pain which a physical therapy doctor....he basically said use heat on your neck and do trapezius stretches. I asked if it was connected to me having constant burners and stinging sensations in my neck....he said yeah its all connected.  Well, i did the religious neck stretches and the facial pain still came back.This past October  after a sleepless busy weekend i had one of the worst flares at work on a night shift. It wasnt a typically described TN attack, my left face felt feverish, and every now and then i would feel a burner in my cheek.A visit to a walk in clinic later, Dr says it must be TN and now im on baclofen as well as amitryptyline (which ive taken since aug 2018 ).My Gp has referred me to a neurologist which im waiting on. Ive been feeling extremely depressed and anxious about this. Its hard for me to express this to my boyfriend, and usually just end up crying. There were mornings when i am genuinely scared to wake up because i dont know how bad it will be that particular day. On top of having flu last month, and stomach flu last weekend, i feel like its gotten worse. That skin crawling burning/pressure i feel on my left cheek is there most of the time, but way worse when im working. Combined with this my ear is also sensitive, as well as the entire side of my scalp, and even the bad of my neck is tender. Ill feel a searing muscle pain go straight down my neck and left shoulder when i have a flare at work. Its horrible and i feel like my muscles are being squeezed. I have a feeling my facial neuropathy has to be related to this chronic nerve pain ive been dealing with for almost 2 years now. I don't think there is compression because i dont feel the level of pain that is described by other TN sufferers. It has to be some kind of pain centralization? The only time i got relief before my facial pain began, was starting a ketogenic diet which reduced inflammation......and being the thinner person i am i was worried i was losing weight. After a month and a half i went back to my regular diet. Im planning on doing keto again, because i am at a loss as to what to do now. I dont want to be on meds forever and i want my life back. I""m scared that this is the beginning to actual TN, getting a taste of it is hard enough to bear. Today i stayed home from work, and i feel like my face is feverish, like sweaty but with no fever. My heart goes out to all of you who have this. Right now im taking it day by day, as i continue waiting on doctors, which being in canada, will be awhile still.",0.0,0.685756,0.501327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19490445859872613
c,"Please keep in mind, my back pain was not a slipped disk. I don't know how that works with FT. I am surprised to hear FT mentioned here. I'll tell you my story. When I was 18, I did the dumbest thing possible. I lifted more than I could handle out of pride. I felt something give. I suffered pain every day from that moment on. It was hip pain and lower back pain. I would have to rest after standing on the same spot for 10 minutes. I did everything; I worked on my flexibility. I spoke to my doctors and nothing. I could not touch my toes when I started but even when I could and more, I did a bit of yoga, the back pain was there. I could not run on the treadmill or outside. I could not work out.  Then for some weird reason, I found this man talking about foundation training. I don't even remember where this video came from or how I landed there. Maybe youtube recommended it. I don't know but it's been the best thing to happen to me. It taught me just how weak I was on a foundation level. I did it daily for a week without seeing results. Then I did it for 2 more weeks and suddenly I could wash dishes standing still without any problems. Then I could run and workout again. I stopped doing the video at this point, after 4 months of daily practice. I lasted 2 years before the back pain came back. My regular workouts, even the lower back strength exercises, delayed the inevitable. I started doing foundation again except once a week. The first day after I did it, I had no back pain. That week I had 3 days of no back pain. The second week, I had 3. The third, I had five days pain free. Now I can go the whole week pain free but I still do it once a week. It keeps my back strong. I've also had to change my life style. I don't sit in chairs that absorb you. I sit only when there is back and foot support so I can stay upright and relaxed. If I don't have that I can still sit but i know when I go home to my battle station, I have a comfortable but proper chair. I downloaded the video in case I ever lose access to it on YouTube.

c,"I appreciate it. I got a 30 gram pouch of the Red strain and the guy told me to do two teaspoons at night and I couldn't help but think that's way more than 2 grams. I'm thinking of just trying red in the evening a couple times a week at the most and see what it does for my wife's sciatica. She's had particularly bad flare up (she's able to stay standing at work for eight to ten hours but then she gets home and it's bio-freeze, ice packs, massage, and she's using a steroid), and I'd like to find something that gives her better relief for the inflamation and nerve pain that's not steroid based. The NSAIDs will jack up her liver no matter what we do and I realize Kratom has to have some negative effect somewhere but we don't smoke and I maybe drink one beer a night for my kidney stones four nights a week (will probably reduce that to two and not drink it when I do Kratom).",0.0,0.555264,0.833404,0.650672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3620689655172414
c,"Goal short term: Lose body fat. Goal mid term: end my chronic low back pain. Goal long term: get lookin' good, more athletic, and stronger. I'm male, 33 yrs old, bang on 6' tall. My lifts are nothing to brag about, but we all gotta start somewhere. My bench is reasonable, my heaviest sets (3-5 reps) are at my bodyweight at least. My squat is embarrassing, about 60% of my bench (owing in part to the back issues). Deadlift isn't something I've really tried, again because of the back. I started last May. During the period from May to August I lost about 30 lbs taking me from 210lbs to 180lbs. I track everything (EVERYTHING) in MyFitnessPal and made sure to always be under my calorie goal (2500 calories). During this period I didn't really follow much of a workout guide. I found a couple programs online (one was a one-month get-back-into-the-gym deal) and then started hunting for what to do next. I consider my first goal pretty well met. My friend told me about Shortcut to Size, so after reading a little I did a cycle of Shortcut to Size and put on about 6 lbs over the 3 month cycle. During that time I followed the StS meal plan (3700 calories a day, 1.5g/lb protein). My lifts did improve quite a bit, but I don't have exact numbers because I didn't really baseline well before starting. My squat is still really poor and deadlift isn't a part of the StS routine. (Romanian deadlifts are the primary hamstring movement, but I don't think they're the same thing.) My increasing core strength, I think, has led to my back hurting a lot less. I can feel a sheet a new muscle all the way across my mid-section. I have a lot more definition in my abdominal area, not shredded but noticeable improvements. I also used the ""Pain Free Abs"" video by Athlean-X (where I first heard of them) to self diagnose anterior pelvic tilt. I have all the symptoms he describes in the video. I was able the past two weeks to have back-pain free leg days. I didn't squat more, it just didn't wreck my back. I consider my second goal to be coming along nicely. As for goal 3, I'm beginning to wonder if StS is actually a little too advanced for me. It's a standard 4 day split, doing each major body part once per week. I'm 2 weeks in to my second round of it. I'm not sure if major lifts once per week is enough for me as I feel like I'm just starting out.

s,"Hi,So, kinda long, sorry. I (F29) have been dealing with abdominal pain and swelling along with intense back pain for about a month now. I’ve spent most nights lying on a heating pad and unable to button or zip any of the pants I own because of the swelling. Finally, the pain was bad enough that I couldn’t sleep or get comfortable. I went to the ER. They did urine test, blood work, and a CT scan with contrast and found an ovarian cyst that was 3.3 cm (1.29 inches) in size. They basically just said the cyst was irritating my body and then, cyclically, the irritation was causing pain - which was causing more irritation. They gave me 800 mg ibuprofen to help with the swelling and pain and sent me on my way.A week later, and things hadn’t improved. I was still in intense pain, still swollen. My chiropractor strongly encouraged me to see my gyno ASAP. I got a lunchtime appointment on a Wednesday. I saw him and brought a copy of the report. He read the report, examined me internally and externally, and determined that I needed emergency surgery on Friday. Surgery proceeded and seemed to go well. At my follow-up yesterday (5 days after surgery), he said that when he did the surgery, he didn’t find any endometriosis, scarring, or other abnormalities. He just found “a very large cyst”. I asked how large it was and he made a circle gesture with his thumb and forefinger roughly the size of two golf balls put together! 😱 Then he said they pulled it out through the incision in my belly button. (HOW?! 😳) I guess that means it must’ve been growing in size fairly rapidly because it was only 3.3 cm (1.29 inches) when I went to the ER for pain only a week before the surgery. He pulled off all my surgical glue and told me that 2 out of 3 incisions were already closed. The last one hadn’t quite closed. He put some surgical tape over it to help give it support. He told me to leave it on for 2-3 days. He said to refrain from heavy lifting or going to the gym for another 2 ish weeks but that I was fine to do normal house hold stuff. I’d been doing 1/2 work days in the actual office with the other 1/2 of the work day being spent working from home where I could accommodate my needs to lie down, sit down, or work standing up more easily. In other words, things seemed to be going well! I had been feeling better and hadn’t taken any Advil since about 10 am that morning. By about 8:45 pm, I had to take some Advil. Underneath the area where the doctor had pulled off the glue from the not-quite-sealed incision, the swelling and pain were worse, and it almost felt like little muscle twitches were occurring. This morning, right before heading to a work meeting, I noticed that I had a red rash and what I would describe as little blisters (like when a sunburn is peeling) where the ends of the little pieces of medical tape were touching my skin. I was having some kind of allergic reaction to the tape on my skin. Not being sure if the increased swelling/pain were related to this new symptom, I called the doctor’s office. I spoke with the doctor, who asked me to describe the issue. Then, he prescribed me an oral antibiotic (in case something was also going on internally) and a topical cream to rub on the irritated skin. He told me if I wasn’t feeling better by tomorrow  (Friday) night, I was supposed to call him. I’ve noticed that the area around my left hip crease has been very tender and still looks swollen too. I’m not sure if that’s normal or not. Overall, I’m feeling sore, swollen, tired, and I just want to get better! Do any of you have experience with laparoscopy or ovarian cyst issues that you’d mind sharing? Or tips for dealing with the swelling/pain from surgery? I’m feeling particularly frustrated because my best friend’s wedding is Saturday - and I’m in it! I feel like total crap and to make matters worse, my doctor is leaving on Sunday for two weeks. 😭 Thanks in advance for your sharing!

c,"*In case this story gets deleted/removed:* **I realized I was childfree while 5 months pregnant** I was 23. This was a couple of years ago. I married my high school sweetheart. We had been together for 7 years and one missed period later, I was  pregnant. I had a nice job as an RN at a hospital near home and he was in finance. We were happy so I was excited at the prospect of motherhood. Cue the worst 5 months of my life. I had extreme acne. My face, chest and back. It was so severe, it hurt to sleep on my face. I had never had acne, save for a few PMS spots. I gained about 17kgs. Thing is, I was petite and a little over 50kgs. I was and still am a vegetarian so my diet was pretty tame. Didn’t eat sugar or junk food. I couldn’t understand why I gained so much. My hair started falling out. This one hit me the hardest. I had to shave my hair and it was the worst experience. The doctor told me not to worry because at the least ‘my boy was okay.’ My husband just couldn’t get it. All I was was a walking incubator for his child who was already wreaking havoc on my mind and body.  I was depressed and anxious, wondering what new atrocity would be thrown my way. My mom said words that shook me to the core. “Hun, you think it’s bad now. Wait till he’s born.” I broke. One afternoon at work, I feigned a backache and got the rest of the day off. I drove to an abortion clinic and the deed was done. I was so incredibly relieved and happy. I got home crying and told my husband I’d lost the child. He was in shock. A few months later we were divorced. I moved countries and have been living here since.  I’m 34 now, living my best life. My job is pretty demanding due to covid but I’m happy. Children take a hold of your life before they’re born.  I couldn’t have had it any other way.

s,"I've been trying to research it but am having trouble finding much information or discussion about it.It's apparently made by shredding the leather scraps left over after most of a hide is used for genuine leather products, or possibly sometimes from recycled used leather products (unclear how often this is the case). Then it is layered with plastic/resin to make basically a leather equivalent to plywood. I've read various figures for how much actual leather is in bonded leather, but it seems to be between 10-20%.Ethically speaking, I understand genuine leather isn't really a byproduct of the meat industry, and I avoid that. But is bonded leather just a byproduct of the leather industry, since it assures scrap/leftover leather isn't just trashed? Or does buying bonded leather products substantially increase the demand for/price of leather overall and thereby increase cow deaths &amp; suffering? How much does the value of leftover leather scraps contribute to the overall value of a hide? Would getting rid of bonded leather entirely improve the situation for cows at all, or would they be still be slaughtered in equal numbers for the genuine leather? I can't figure out where to even start looking for actual numbers.I'm also not at all clear on how relatively bad it is for the environment, compared to other materials.I ask because I'm trying to decide if I can buy a chair containing bonded leather or not, since I hate mesh chairs (back pain), and fabric chairs that fit me seem to be basically non-existent at affordable prices, and my back is killing me.

s,"I'm glad I found this subreddit, I've been wanting to rant about this for a little while but feel like a lot of people won't really understand. Thank you ahead of time if you read through this. I'm 30 years old (f 5'0"") and got to 367lbs this year. Last year around this time I was about 310 and working out regularly, religiously counting calories etc.  (I got down to 298 starting at 350 in 2019) I had been seeing a personal trainer, and still seeing a personal trainer. Despite being in my 300's we did a ""fight for air climb"" where I went up 40 flights of stairs, I had no body pain from my weight and I felt great. The problem for me that I found though is that I suffer from binge eating and would often eat to even punish or sabotage myself. Basically I'd lose weight, gain some weight, lose some weight, gain some weight. Any type of stresser: up in weight, because I would eat to cope with that stress. If I lose 15lbs I'd cheat and binge thinking that I better eat this while I can because it'll be a while until I can have it again. Sometimes if I came home angry from work I'd binge eat as if to punish myself for being angry and to take my frustration out on myself from food and fill this void with food.It got to a point last year where I just really struggled. The start of this year I was about 325 and got down to about 315 - then COVID happened. I **skyrocketed** to my weight and I fell into a pretty bad state of depression. I didn't lose my job or anything, I've been very fortunate. But being alone in my apartment and getting rid of that routine destroyed me. My apartment had looked like a hoarders filled with takeout boxes and bags that I couldn't be bothered to put together and take out. This was in May. I found it difficult to walk, I found myself getting severe lower back pain from my peak weight making me even more lethargic and found it difficult to get myself to clean because even the time it'd take me to shower I'd be in back pain (and still do). This was basically my ""I have to do something or I'm going to ruin my life"" moment and I started looking at therapists that focus on eating disorders to help me get my shit in gear. I found it a little difficult but I really asked questions and got their thoughts before going with them. Some of them were staunchly ""health at every size"" and that they'd discourage me from losing weight and I was just like ""lady I'm 5'0"" at 370 and can't walk 3 blocks without needing to sit down, this is not health at every size"" and knew I'd have to find someone else.Luckily I found someone, bless her heart and kindness, but she's been directing me in the intuitive eating direction and allowing me to experiment. First it was dropping diets, listening to myself, am I hungry, or am I stressed out? I toyed around with things while I desperately tried to change my life around me. I spent almost all of June cleaning my apartment. Just weeks of doing a little bit of cleaning here and there. Setting a stool down in front of my kitchen sink and doing dishes. Every day force myself to take 2 bags of garbage out and collect 2 bags of garbage for the next day. I'd have to sit down exhausted every time in back pain when I was done with that small task.It wasn't until about July that I really started moving forward with spending more of my energy on intuitive eating with my apartment in a manageable appearance (I can cook and use my counters and wouldn't be embarrassed if someone came by!) I tried a number of things while dealing with my apartment.  Shake diet to make something nutritious but quick and easy while I didn't have energy. (I got tired of that real quick and would order out). I tried grocery delivery (limited items to be healthy and easy to cook without spending a lot of energy on cooking because I had no energy). But I found that it wasn't enough food and I'd still order out anyway because I either didn't feel like eating what was delivered to me or I just simply didn't have enough food to last for all meals.Then I had a thought of ""What if I just buy a SHIT ton of food (healthy and foods I wanted) and have enough food to cook whatever I want throughout the month?"" and lo and behold that seemed to be the secret sauce for me. I didn't feel like food was a limited item and that I had to eat it quick because it'd go away and not be back for a while. I didn't feel cravings because I entered the day ""What do I feel like eating today, oo I could make this"" and actually enjoy the process of cooking. There were no bad foods or good foods, though everything I ate was on the healthy side. But if I wanted a baked potato with some butter, I had it. **I went this entire month not having binge urges, I went this entire month not having cravings of takeout food.** I've gone this entire month feeling satisfied, physically and emotionally. This is a ground breaking change for me. Last Sunday I weighed 359, though recently my therapist threw in a curve ball for me and requested I stopped checking the scale. I gave a waiver to allow her to discuss myself with my physical trainer on how those two could work together so that my trainer didn't accidentally undermine my therapist with 'good foods' 'bad foods' 'stay away from x' kind of thing. He's going to weigh me now, but she told me he isn't to tell me what I weigh. I thought he'd still tell me when I hit check points and what not though. I had given him my scale last Tuesday and since then I had been shocked at how much I actually relied on my scale to determine how I feel for the day. If it's down I feel like I'm doing great and doing a good job. If it's the same I'm frustrated and gotta 'keep with this' and keep going. If it's up then it's ""ugh, I need to change something and do better"". Every day. Wake up, go to the bathroom, weigh myself, and judge myself based on the number on the scale.I told my therapist how surprised I was that I kind of had this need for my scale to tell me how I feel now that I don't have it. We had a big ""aha"" moment in me. She encouraged me to find the strength to not know my weight at all from my trainer, but she said she'd concede and allow him to let me know if there was a trend of me gaining weight to help redirect me and potentially change something so I wouldn't be stressing that I'm gaining weight. I've been kind of stunned about it honestly. I asked her what about knowing once I'm out of my 300's? Because that's a HUGE deal for me. (no pun intended). She shook her head and just said nope, that I shouldn't be concerned about the number I'm at but instead focus on how I FEEL. I'll see changes in my body if I'm losing weight. But for me to learn how to find different ways to appreciate how I feel and not let a number determine how I feel. This seemed a little silly to me (and my trainer) but he and I worked out even today and we both agreed we'd give this an honest shot and see where it takes us because the fact I've gone an entire month without cravings foods or binging is a huge telling sign that I'm headed in a good direction.But I thought about it even more tonight, and realized there were a lot of benefits to me not checking my weight. I have this habit of getting an urge to ""cheat"" every few weeks when I calorie count and check my weight. After about 10-15lbs I'm like ""Ive been good for a while, I'll cheat"" and often that cheat meal turns into a cheat day. Then I probably feel sick the next day and lethargic and that cheat day turns into another cheat day. Then resentment and it turning into a cheat week. When I look at the scale I'm playing a game in my head on when I can cheat again. Whereas today I thought ""Maybe I'll go and grab two slices of pizza when I get paid again"" but did it in a ""okay, if I want some then I'll go get some"" but not in this *I can't wait until I get paid and cheat because I want this food so bad and know I can't have it.* But as weird as not knowing my weight is, I can see the perks as much as letting go of dieting. I feel good tonight. I accomplished a lot, enjoyed some corn tortillas and ground beef tacos and ready for bed.

c,"My MRI looked almost like yours, just that two other discs had started to herniate as well. Get yourself a good doctor, I worked with a neurosurgeon, a physiotherapist and a GP that specialised in back pain.  After a year of pt, conservative treatments and trying to get through the day with pain meds my leg and foot got so bad that I couldn't feel them anymore, I had to drag my leg cause it wouldn't respond the way it should have.  I got operated, got to go home 4 days after the surgery and was completely pain free for over 2 years. I had other problems come up with my back a few weeks ago, but that's a whole other issue. Something you might want to ask, what I can't see on your MRI here: could Spondylolisthesis be an issue? It might help to know.  Anyway, as others and you yourself have said: surgery should be the last option, but in your case it might be the only way to help you.  My doctor told me to keep a pain diary, to see if the levels of pain that I was having were something I could live with or not, and also to see if it was getting better. And pt, conservative therapy take a long time to show results. If your leg gets worse you know that that disc is pushing too far on your nerves, so really look out for that. Also, if you have problems with bladder control that's a sign as well.  How fast you heal from the surgery depends on how old you are, your weight, general health, etc., so that's another thing to consider.

What I have left out of the letter is on Sunday, the schedule manager accused me of bad performance in my new position, which was complete bs, while still saying she will schedule me there. I do not know whether to address this in the letter, and HOW without sounding whiny or defensive or attacking a higher up.Dear John,I just wanted to thank you again for putting me on floor X, and for letting the other managers know.. I cannot understate how grateful I am and how my skills and knowledge are best used there. I realized after working there last week my presence there helps in another way: a lot of the seasonal staff do not know how to find merchandise on the system, or order them. Some of them also struggle finding some of the stock. I have taken the time to train them when I see them struggling, and offer pointers as well to ensure their success. I was wondering if there is anything more I can do to bolster my usefulness to the business in working on floor X? I was put back at cash on Sunday. Today, someone had pencilled in I was to be on floor X on the roster, but a manager soon sent me back to cash until the line cleared up, and every manager after said I was to stay there for the rest of my shift. I will be brutally honest with you: I broke down tonight. I asked to go to the restroom and wept for 15 minutes. My request to go home early was declined. My physiotherapist is happy to write a note about my back pain and arm’s numbness, and I can ask my primary physician as well.

s,"Hello everybody, I'm currently 19 years old, I just moved into a college dorm for my freshman year. I'm going to tell you a quick story in the hopes that it can motivate you to stay clean so you can live a happy drug free life. Even though I don't know most of you, I don't want to see you end up like my best friend, my fucking brother practically.My friend died on September 9th at the age of 18 years old. Think about that, only 18 years old. I met him 2 years ago, and I was only smoking weed at the time, I started smoking weed when I was 13, then at 15 I started to take pyschedelics, then at 17 I started to do cocaine, and at 18 I was doing opiates. I just kept opening those doors 🚪 and doing more and more drugs. I want to be clear that I never shot up, I was never willing to do it. I only ever snorted boy when I was coming down from the girl. My friend on the other hand shot up.I met him when I was 17 years old, I met him through some people and it was funny at first because he had the exact same name as me so whenever we would introduce ourselves to new people I would say I'm #1 and this is #2 hahah. So this kid I met, I can't tell you how hard of a life this kid had growing up. His dad died when he was young, his first brother (oldest) went to prison at the age of around 20 years old, his step dad was an alcoholic who treated him like shit, his mother was also an alcoholic who turned a blind eye to it. From the age of 13 his parents were gone every weekend, he was left at the house alone for days with his twin brother to fend for themselves, make their own food, make their own money for food.Well around the age of 17 when I met him I started to do quite a bit of cocaine, at the most me and him would get 1g to maybe an eight ball and be done with it in about a day. Everytime we did drugs,, we would freestyle for hours, it was our favorite thing to do and I have hours upon hours of video recordings of us, and we just got better and better at it to the point when we'd go to parties everyone was impressed by how well we'd do. Well we'd take a break for about a month or two of the cocaine then start doing it again. We'd always do it with other people too in big groups which was more fun and go out to college towns to party while we did it even though we were seniors in high-school or just do it at his house since his parents were gone all the time. I always remembered the comedown was so fucking godawful. We'd rarely do it but as time progressed we started upping the frequency of our usage. Then we started doing heroin, I never shot up but he did and we'd only do it to ease the comedown of the cocaine. It wasnt until maybe 6 months of only having done it like 40 times, I found out he had done it 100s of times and was shooting up boy much more frequently. His parents are low life pieces of shit alcoholics who didn't care what happened to him, I always made sure to show him that I loved him like a brother more than his own brother who he'd just fight with all the time. I in all, did about a gram to an eight ball at a time up to maybe 40 times at max our senior year and only snorted heroin like 10 times of like a .1 each time. He on the other hand had done cocaine 100s of times and started out snorting heroin to shooting up heroin to doing heroin more and more frequently.Well then, college started, so i stopped doing all drugs besides occasionally smoking weed but he stop doing drugs. I remember that after about 3 weeks in college I go drive to my hometown to get some boy, I get back to my dorm and snort about .5 that night, well next day I woke up on the ground with my left eye swollen shut. I had fallen off the bed and hit my left eye near my eyebrow on the air conditioner that was stapled into the ground. It caused me to pass out and when I woke up my left eye was completely swollen shut. At this point I called my mom who is divorced from my father and she calls the ambulance. I get picked up from my dorm and taken to the hospital. I was confirmed to have a concussion so I stayed there for about a week. During my stay my friend had died the same exact day I hit my head and got a concussion. So my mother told me when she eventually got to the hospital ""Your friend is dead honey."" I said ""What"" then I started crying. Right after I then forgot and said ""What happened to my friend mom."" She looks at me funny and says ""Your friend died honey, remember."" I started to cry and then I forgot. I repeated to her ""Mom what happened to my friend."" And at this point it went on for about 50 times. After so many times hearing then forgetting it my mom just told me to rest. I was whimpering but I wasn't able to cry, the drugs for so long had me completely numbed.Next day I get out of the hospital and we go to his funeral, I see all my friends there and we're all sad. Afterwards I go back home to my moms and have to stay there for about a couple days until my head injury recovers. Its at nighttime at this point the day of the funeral. I sit there laying, unable to even cry, I'm scrolling through youtube and see this video pop up - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pJaYfCpeXMo it's a channel called ChrisAndPops LetMeTellYouWhatHappen - I told my daddy share some of them crabs. I sit there for 2 hours just watching their channel, then the biggest realization of my entire life hit me all at once. #LetMeTellYouWhatHappenMy entire life, I've been unable to connect with my father, I so wanted as a kid to bond with him more than anything, but consciously I wasn't aware of this. I would see other kids playing with their father but all me and him did was talk about business, I needed that love/physical connection and because I grew up not having it, a part of me was very broken and shoved all the pain deep down. Subconsciously I knew what was bugging me the whole time and as a result I started to do things to get my fathers attention like acting out in school at a young age, doing drugs to numb the pain, I was getting into fights, I ended up in jail at age 15, I just did a whole lot of bullshit. My brother did the same thing, he acted out in school but never did drugs or go to the extreme like me, he quickly matured. We both wanted our fathers attention I just went way more to the extreme to try and get it even if it meant him yelling at me or acting out. So I sit there and after about 40 videos watched, a realization hit me, every friend I've ever had, had father issues, I've had 5 best friends and every single one of them had trouble connecting with their father. I'm Buddhist so I believe we will keep attracting the same type of people, scenarios, and concurrences into our life until we solve what's going on within ourselves. That's essentially why rehab has such a huge fail rate, they don't get to the root of the issues, they just keep putting on that bandade. Immediately after this realization I run to the toilet and I throw up, it wasnt a regular throw up though, it was a black tar ball that came out of me. I want to tell you guys, I have been having leg pain for YEARS, nothing has helped, no doctor no chiropractor, absolutely nothing has worked. Immediately right after I purged this demon out of me sorta like an ayahuasca purge, I cried and I cried and I cried more than I have ever cried in my entire life. As I was crying I literally felt my leg pain dissipating. When I was finally done all my back pain and leg pain disappeared. All my cravings to do drugs disappeared. The next day I go back to college. Realizing everything that had happened, whats the first thing I decided to do. Well I had weed stored over and as soon as I go to smoke it, I get paranoid AF, something that has never happened to me. I feel the huge urge to get unhigh whereas before I couldn't control the urges not to get high and I needed more and more to numb the pain. Yet at this point there was no more pain to numb. I threw away the bag of weed. So here we are today, my concussion is healed, I finished this semester with the highest grade in all my classes even though I missed 3 weeks of school, I workout everyday now, I started practicing meditation and yoga, I'm making new friends who don't do drugs, and I've been drug free from September 10th to December 25. I say December 25th because guess what happened, I decided to do cocaine to celebrate how good I've been doing and you know what I happened, I had a heart attack from .1g of coke, not it wasnt cut I get it from the same dude as always. My friend had to give me mouth to mouth to bring me back to life then I had to go to the hospital for the day to recover. I realized how fucking stupid that was to go back but this has never happened before. So I go to smoke weed, I get paranoid, I try to do coke and I have a heart attack, I don't even want to think about what will happen if I fuck with tha boy. Something in me is physically unable to do drugs anymore whereas before this never happened. So I've decided to become completely sober for the rest of my life, I'll only drink wine very rarely on special occasions, but no weed, liquor, coke nothing.I'm in awe how even though I tried to go back to the old me, I literally couldn't my body wouldn't let me. So maybe what I'm trying to say is, who knows if the reason your still addicted to drugs or had started doing drugs in the first place has something to do with your past. I just wanted to share this story for anyone out there who is still struggling, there's hope.

As any kid does I sat in the back so I can play with my toys alone without having to hear my parents talking up a storm. That day we were stopped at a red light and all of a sudden something hits us from the back, I go flying into the front seat and hit my head really hard on the head rest. What hit us was a huge public bus filled with people. Apparently the driver wasn't paying attention and didn't hit his brakes on time and since it was raining the bus slid on the wet pavement and eventually hit our car from the back and we hit 2 other cars in front of us from the force of impact. Since mini-vans don't have much trunk space the back seat (where I was) got most of the force. Ever since that day I've had terrible back pain. It gets really bad when I'm sitting, laying down, or standing for long periods of time.  I've gone to the chiropractor &amp; physical therapy.I feel like these have only been a temporary relief. X-rays and MRI's have shown that I have two bulging vertebrae discs.  What I have done that I've found helps: is exercise. I do various back strengthening exercises at the gym and try to maintain my back muscles as strong as possible because the muscles are what hold your spinal cord and vertebrae in place and prevent them from pinching nerves and such. I am not entirely sure about your situation but definitely go to the doctor and get cleared to do exercise, don't go overboard and start lifting a ton of weights (otherwise you will strain your back too much) do light lifting that will help you gain strength in your back muscles.

Didn't last as long as i thought but family enjoyed it, it seemed. After, instead of going home I took them to hang out at the mall. No shopping, just browsing. Son was really into it as it's an upscale mall and he was fascinated by the high priced shit. Wife seemed happy following along, drooling over her own expensive wants.  Started initiating (twice, once successfully) and flirting again since our big fight couple weeks ago. She's becoming more open to general affection. Such as this morning, i pulled her in close, nibbled her neck, grabbed her ass, gave her a kiss. She was open. Normally she'd tell me to stop. Son is still being lazy with school work, admitting to just not doing shit cause he doesn't want to. Makes no fucking sense to me. /u/rocknrollchuck pointed me to a previous comment thread he had regarding punishing children. I need to look into it more but the gist i got was he's getting more attention from me with his bad grades than he is with his good grades. I don't disagree. While he was grounded from his phone he would spend more time with me but he'd also fall asleep much earlier, like 7. He says he's sleeping fine but obviously not. Or he's just bored out of his mind. I can't occupy 100% of his free time nor should I. He needs to find things to do. He has hobbies. He's just not engaged in it right now. I need to somehow enable him to recognize how to get himself back on track. When wife got back from her business trip I honestly wasn't looking forward to it. I didn't miss her. But I think the time since has been good so, we'll see how it goes. She's heading back out again next week for a few days. Then home for the holidays.  She decided to deep clean the house Sunday. I asked my son to help. I did some minor things and cleaned my office, but largely worked on my personal shit and watched some football. When i wasn't working I was always the one cleaning, and detailed. Since I started working again I told her I was done with that shit. I'll fix shit, clean kitchen after she cooks, and take care of my office, but her and my son can do the rest. I don't give a fuck if the house smells rancid (four pets dont help). My point being she needs to step up her chores. It's not as often as I'd like and she defers vacuuming to my son. But besides cooking dinner, she does very little around the house. She doesn't even fold her own fucking clothes (I used to fold them for her but stopped months ago). I need to figure out how to lead better in this area, too.

I had such throbbing and stiff lower back pain I was cringing every time I had to stand up. I take turmeric extract for internal inflammation (GI and female pains) but when I take it frequently or in high doses it upsets my stomach. So I did some research and discovered Wobenzym.

The stiff feeling is still there on occasion but practically no pain!  I have also noticed, as a female, my period pain is significantly lower. No changes to libido but mine is already high in a healthy way. I take 3 first thing in the morning, no food for about an hour after consumption. That's it.

s,"I had my baby shower yesterday. It was mostly nice.One of my husband's aunts got smashingly drunk during the party. This is not unusual; drunk is his family's default mode, and they are fun drunk people. Except that this particular drunk aunt tossed her kids into our hot tub without supervising them and without any swim gear (you know, like swim diapers intended to contain feces).The littlest one promptly pooped. The older kids mashed their feet in it before I could notice and spread poop particulate throughout the whole tub.Soooo the aunt decided to leave with her children immediately. As in, trying to drive while so drunk that she could barely stand up. She was angry when we intervened and got someone sober to take her and her screaming children home.Did I mention the part where she didn't help clean up the poop at. all.This hot tub is the only thing getting me through SPD and sciatica this pregnancy. I don't have a bath tub in the house, so this is it for floaty times. I keep the temperature low so I don't cook the fetus (like 98F, cooler than your average bath) and float for about an hour at the end of the day, every day, so that I can actually sleep comfortably.Now there's poop all over it. My husband has drained it so he can scrub it but he's busy today, so the cleaning job is half-finished until at least tomorrow. Once it's sterilized, we'll have to refill it (which is not free, btw, especially since we live in a desert) and heat it back up to a pleasantly lukewarm temperature (also not free). This will take time. Time that I cannot soak my hips in the hot tub and sleep comfortably.I don't even care that your kid shit in my hot tub, Aunt. Shit happens. Literally. There have been so many kids in my hot tub that a poop incident was inevitable. I do care about how rude you were all over my damn house and that you wouldn't even scoop your own kid's floaters. (""She's almost three. She's virtually potty trained!"" Yeah sure right.) And you drank all the alcohol. And I didn't sleep well last night.

c,"No worries! Usual pathway is to see a GP to be examined, and have a decision whether or not imaging is required (usually an MRI). If surgery is required then either ortho referral or neurosurg referral.  From there, it’s commencing some simple pain relief and advising home physiotherapy. If ongoing, referral to a physiotherapist for their assessment and ongoing management would be appropriate, as well as considering different pain relief meds that can be introduced and titrated.   Back pain is hella complex, and patient can end up being referred to pain management specialists for various forms of pain management/relief.  A big part of the management is, however, physiotherapy/stretches. I gather not all chiropractors are as extreme as this gif; there is overlap between physio and chiropody in that they both involve joint manipulation, so it could be that your dad is going there and essentially getting a bit of physiotherapy.  Of course, my belief is that physiotherapy is the only real safe way of joint manipulation, and should be done by a physiotherapist.  It’s difficult, because of the somewhat mysteriousness behind chiropody, when it helps a patient view placebo/stretching/whatever.. it’s very difficult to get them to change their mind to believe that it isn’t really evidence based, and a physio would be better.",0.0,0.504511,0.674148,0.903477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3051643192488263

s,"Hello,Sorry for the long post, but I'm um-ing and ah-ing about whether I should do anything about an injury I picked up at work.Basically I used to work in an environment that required a lot of heavy lifting and footwork (walked 20+miles a day) and due to the nature of the job safe-lifting techniques weren't always followed - either because it was impossible (think leaning over boxes to lift up another one weighing 15kg, so all in the lower back) or strongly discouraged due to fear of reprisals for being too slow.At the time of the injury I had worked for this company for around 7 months in total - so there was likely an element of wear and tear. Was bending down to lift up a comparatively light box (about 5-7kg iirc) twisted to move and drop it to my left and I put my back out. Went down like a sack of potatoes. Waited a while in some pain, but very, very slowly carried on seeing if I could work it off. Needless to say, I finished that task, went to do another and down I went again - so off I went to inform a manager. They said basically to try a different task despite the fact I was in a lot of pain. I tried, but when it got to the point where I was struggling to lift anything without pain, and when I could just barely walk, I went back as said it wasn't working so they reluctantly sent me home. I wrote it in the accident book.Managed to make it home in quite some pain (probably 6-7/10 on the pain scale), took some painkillers and went straight to bed and had some very poor sleep. Went to the doctors the next day and they signed me off work for a week initially. Tested and there was no nerve damage, and it was suspected to be muscular. This being said I was having pain down the front of my right thigh, and this may have been caused by irritation on the nerve, but not sciatica. Should have healed within 1-2 weeks, apparently.Gave my sick note in, although due to money problems I instead accepted to take a week off as paid holiday. Pain quickly dissipated, and I ""recovered"" just enough to get back to work the following week although really could have done with another week. Since then I now have good days and bad days. Lower back is permanently stiff and pain comes and goes. Mostly when moving but also when sitting on a bad day. Some days I'm back to normal and could lift a car, the next I can barely bend down. Bizarre numbness and pain on the right thigh, especially after walking. Not painful per se, but annoying and uncomfortable. Anyway that was 8 weeks ago. I haven’t been back to the doctors as I don't think there much they can do. Don't need or want any stronger painkillers, and it not severe enough to warrant surgery or further investigation. It's been 2 months since the accident and it pretty much levelled out and looking like it might be a long term thing now.In terms of legal action, I was thinking about contacting one of these no-win-no-fee lawyers advertised, but I was curious as to whether it would even be worth it? And if I do, should I wait to see if I do recover? How long do I wait? What will I need to prove or get evidence of?Many thanks!",0.0,0.671923,0.893346,0.648829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23728813559322035

s,"Age - 23Sex - MaleHeight - ~175cmWeight - ~76kgAdditional info: A recent MRI diagnosed me with having a degenerated disc and a herniated disc, both in the lower back.Hey all. My back pain issues are a little weird. They began about 6 years ago and have steadily gotten worse since then (though at a slow enough rate it only becomes obvious in retrospect). My back tends not to be in pain when I'm standing straight up or when I'm lying straight down, but almost any other position causes pain to occur - lying with a pillow, lying on my side, and in particular, sitting. The pain tends to be in my lower/middle back.This has really been a majorly limiting factor in my life. I cannot sit down for more than an hour or two without pain, which means there's a lot of jobs I can't really do. I use a standing desk at home but due to (unrelated) knee pain I can't stand all day either. Though my recent MRI gave us a bit more information, my doctor was unable to say too much more - apparently plenty of people have similar disc issues without the consequent pain, and he (alongside almost every other professional I've seen over the last 6 years) was utterly unable to explain why the pain occurs in particular when sitting. He gave no prognosis and only recommended I see a spine physiotherapist. He said that though surgery was an option it was as likely to make things worse as it was to help.This already limits my life and I'm scared it's only going to get worse without my even fully understanding what's happening or what I can do to stop it. Does anyone have any familiarity with similar issues and can give me a sense either of what to expect in the future or what might help?",0.0,0.712595,0.833927,0.864668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2980769230769231

s,"I finally went back to work today. I work in healthcare.Today, I had a full company meeting with a lot of doctors/nurses/CNAs/etc. present. It's the first time I've been back since I ended up hospitalized a few weeks ago, and I've been dealing with the pain ever since.As soon as I walked in the room, the whole medical-professional component of the company stopped and we had a short meeting to talk through everything that's happening with me. I have never seen a group of doctors and nurses look so concerned as they all did when I first entered the room. All any of them knew about this was that I had been hospitalized and was having some back pain. They pulled a chair up and helped me sit down--I didn't even realize I needed help but they refused to let me do anything without assistance.They then talked through the obvious symptoms. Apparently, my posture, my gait, the pain, and my severely decreased mobility are all signs of something that should've been taken care of 2 weeks ago when I was first sent to the ER. Our head nurse said, ""The fact that they didn't order an MRI right then and try to figure out what happened might be grounds for a malpractice suit. You should not be up and walking. You need help, and now.""I have an MRI scheduled tomorrow, so they let the issue go, but one of our nurses (who has a close working relationship with every hospital in the surrounding 3 counties) asked if she could accompany me and ensure that I am taken care of properly (being that apparently my last ER visit was horrifyingly mis-managed). I declined, but I suspect she might be showing up anyway and making a lot of phone calls--god damn my co-workers are beautiful people.Anyway, I've had an MRI before. I had (have) a lump in my leg, which turned out to just be a strange fatty deposit on top of some muscle. It took about a week for me to hear back about that. So I mentioned that during our little ""meeting""--I said ""Even if it's bad, I figure I have a week until I hear back about any results and then another week until we can get a surgery or anything scheduled if that's what needs to happen. So I'd rather not worry about it.""Our head nurse shakes her head. ""When the MRI happens, if there's nothing obvious, it might take a week for them to give you results. If there's something questionable, they may take 24-48 hours to examine the scans and try to figure out what your risks and course of action is. The way you are currently walking, I think you will be given your results before you get off the table. I am going to assume you won't be in work tomorrow. This may need action before the weekend is up. If that's the case, you need to contact us, immediately, so we can figure out a schedule to check on you daily and bring you necessities, take you to appointments, and get your prescriptions filled.""For some context, I moved 700 miles from home in February.

s,"A year and a half ago, I started having painful cramping and nausea after sex. I started having painful periods every 2-3 months. I would have acute cramping that made me curl up in a ball and sit on the toilet. It made me bloated, I had diarrhea, vomited, felt lightheaded, and gave me back pain. I went to 2 gynecologists who both suspected endo and recommended surgery. At that time, I knew nothing about endo and had never done surgery before and had always been healthy before. I was kind of in denial and decided not to do the surgery.As the months passed, my pain became more frequent where it happened every other period, then pretty much every period. Even between my period, sex would trigger it. It was nothing like some of you ladies experience because I felt fine for the rest of the month and it only happened a few days out of the month. But I work as a nurse and I couldn’t afford to have it happen to me while at work or just before work because if I became unable to care for my patients that would endanger them. I was lucky that the intense pain happened when I was at home usually. Ibuprofen didn’t really help and I’d just throw up shortly after taking it if my episode was bad.I got naproxen and toradol prescribed (warning: never take these together, they can cause kidney failure. I took these separately on different days). Toradol helped but you can’t take it regularly because it’s strong and damages your kidneys. I didn’t want to rely on pain meds. I was also scared that my endo was getting worse and would affect my future fertility.So I saw an endo specialist I found from Nancy’s Nook. I feel lucky because he’s in my insurance network and only 15min from my home. He did my surgery on 10/20 and found stage 1 endo (technically stage 2 due to an endometrioma but more like stage 1). He excised all of it except the endometrioma on my ovary. He drained and cauterized it to preserve my ovary. My recovery was about 1 week and I returned back to my normal activities after that.I had a Mirena put in 2 weeks ago. That caused some cramping similar to my endo cramping but on a mild-moderate day. This lasted for 2 days. I haven’t had any cramping or painful symptoms since. I just started a light spotting period a couple days ago and I feel perfectly normal. I’m hopeful that I can focus on my job now, especially during these hard times.Best wishes to all of you ❤️",0.567084,0.666468,0.744446,0.691449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24943820224719102

Had an MRI in September of 2017 which showed a massive herniation at the L4/L5 level. Decided to again try a chiropractor just because I knew if I went to an ortho or neuro they would only talk about injections or surgery. Let me just say this... I have literally tried everything you can think of except an injection or something like STEM cells. I've done the chiro, PT, massage, elec. stim, changed my diet completely, homeopathic remedies, traction, etc. I've tried a numerous amount of all natural anti-inflammatory pills like Reuma-Art and Devil's Claw. Long story short, in November of 2017 I started to get groin and testicular pain. I panicked and made an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic facility in Weston FL where I met my surgeon who will be performing the surgery on me tomorrow (1/31). Within 10 minutes of meeting him, he said surgery is the only answer otherwise I'd be doing more irreversible damage to myself prolonging it more than I already have.

This did not help my pain levels.In the last couple months I've also experienced some sciatica. The first time I recognised it, I remember limping home from university. My legs didn't really hurt but my left hip and kinda upper thigh didn't want me to walk properly. This happened a few more times in the month before I came back to my hometown for Christmas, but now sometimes it's my right leg that hurts, even though it's usually my left.

It's already difficult feeling like I'm 91 rather than 19, but I'm really in trouble if things get worse.

c,"I've been walking everyday since March 30, 2020. I got myself a Fitbit by the second week and it has helped me gameify this workout. At first, I was going to just walk everyday for a week. By the end of the week, I decided to extend it to another week and so forth... At first, I hated walking! If my destination was a block away, I would take my car. I also had anxiety, because I would immediately sweat, my legs hurt and I couldn't stand for even a short while. I would always lean against a wall if there was nothing to sit on to relieve the stress on my lower back and legs. I also have sciatica, so that did not help. But I committed myself to walk for one week. It was rough, especially the first 2-3 days. But, once you pass that hump, it gets a lot easier. I was inspired by Youtubers who have lost weight because they committed to walking everyday for 1 month. That was my goal. Day 1, i barely made 2,500 steps. Then each day, I added 500 more then 500 more to the point where I was committed to doing 10k steps a day.  That 10k steps a day may have been a marketing ploy originally for a pedometer being sold in Japan (https://www.news-medical.net/amp/health/Where-did-10000-steps-a-day-come-from.aspx) but it is still a great goal to do. And with a Fitbit, or even just Google Health on your smartphone, it helped me gameify this goal. Before you know it, I got hooked and it is now part of my daily routine and I do it everyday before I have lunch or because it is getting really hot here in Southern California, I will do it early in the morning. I have routine walking routes but I also set challenges where Saturdays will be my ""tough day"" because I will put in the most steps that day and also a specific route with a lot of hills. BUT, I DO IT and it is so rewarding. Believe me, I empathize with you because I have been exactly you. I didn't want to walk with friends or go to the mall with them because of the intense flop sweat I would immediately get from walking short distances like 100-200 ft short.  But, because of the pandemic, I am working from home and my bubble is my home and neighborhood. Fast forward to today, I rarely have used my car, and I go grocery shopping by walking with a big back pack. Or I go to my local small business owned coffee shop a mile away to grab lunch and cofee several times a week to support them and also, they make the best sandwiches and pastries! With today being August 20, 2020, I have walked everyday consistently for 143 days and after the initial 2 weeks, at least 10k steps each day. I just weighed myself this morning and I have lost 59 lbs since March 30, 2020.  It has become my daily routine and it is no longer a burden. In fact, I crave that walk. It allows me zen time to listen to podcasts, Audible books on tape, my '80s new wave playlists on Spotify, etc. I check my emails during short breaks (I sit at a park bench that has great tree shade) or I hang out at a coffee shop that has outdoor seating and an awning.  I like to get my steps out of the way so I do them all at once but people tend to break them up into mini-walks throughout the day, which is very doable. You just have to get over that hump and I did it. So can you! I am not an athlete, never have been, and have been obese my entire life. But, this routine totally works for me. My anxiety has lowered, I am no longer embarrassed of myself in public or in social situations (well, the ones that I have been in pre-pandemic). I live alone, work fron home, and the lockdown/pandemic, although is awful, has been the kick in the ass that I needed.  The walks have also gameify me to start using MyFitnessPal to log all my meals, practice CICO and intermittent fasting (my eating window is between noon-8pm everyday). It all permeates together and once you get over the nuisance of it all, it becomes your daily routine. It becomes second nature. It allows me to drink the required water I need per day, and drink unsweetened black coffee in the morning to supress my appetite. I am no longer thinking of food all the time. It has eliminated my late night snack cravings.  I have never lost weight consistently before, but this routine is totally working for me. So, again, if I can do it, then anyone can do it.

s,"On Tuesday, through the recommendation of my doctor, I got a second opinion on my shoulder pain and back due to my scoliosis diagnosis from almost a year ago.  I have been seeing a chiropractor who originally diagnosed me with scoliosis. He was able to help me with my back pain which is now nonexistent, which I'm thankful for. However, my shoulder continues to hurt every day; some days aren't bad and some days are terrible. The orthopedic doctor I saw essentially said to me that not much can be done for my shoulder and that ""maybe"" my chiropractor could help me alleviate my pain. I walked out of my appointment feeling nothing but disappointment. Sidetracking a bit, but it's part of my problem. A couple of years ago, I found out that years (5 or so) before I was born my dad got addicted to some drugs and ended up having to go to rehab for it. He doesn't know that I know.I didn't think about it too much after that until this year, and especially this past week. Combined with my possible mental health issues that I know I need to check into and my chronic shoulder pain that doesn't seem to have a cure (My growth plates are closed, so there's not much more bone growth on my end), I worried that my genes might get the best of me, causing me to become addicted to drugs in order to kill my pains. Thank you for reading, I just had to get my thoughts out into the open. ",0.58749,0.663824,0.843944,0.625411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32950191570881227
c,"I'm so sorry for what you're going through. I'm going through it, as well. Although, I seem to be recovering. I'll describe what I've done. I hope it's helpful. Three weeks ago, I was in the most miserable discomfort. 2.5 weeks ago, I couldn't even stand up. 2 weeks ago I wound up in the ER from the pain. I was depressed and wondering if this was my life. Repeated trips to the doctor had done little. Meds that had started out working were no longer effective. At my best, I couldn't stand for more that a minute or two. I could not walk long distances. I was in near constant pain. A little over a week ago, 2 friends who both had years of experience dealing with sciatica, recommended I try arching my back - basically laying on the floor on my stomach and raising up on my elbows in the sphinx pose.  I got home and tried this. After about a half hour, the pain started to subside. For the first time in almost 2 weeks, I could walk a modest distance in some degree of comfort. The next day was Easter Sunday. I got up and did the sphinx thing for a little while, then I rolled over and put a pillow under my back and watched some tv with my son. I was doing better after about an hour. I went to CVS and got a FUTURO Stabilizing Back Support. It was tremendously helpful. I also got a lumbar pillow from Walmart and I use it in my car and sometimes at home. In the walmart, I had to sit down about every 5 minutes or so. Between my friends and my PT, I have a regimen that I do in the morning and again at night, that seems to be working for me 1. I lay on my back, and bring my knees up. Keeping my knees together, I slowly rotate my lower half from side to side 2. I lay on my stomach and poise myself like I'm about to do a push up. I push up as high as I can so that my back arches backward (sphinx pose) and hold it to the count of 10. Then I lower myself down. I do that 10 times. 3. I stretch my hamstrings. Loosening up the hamstrings is - I'm told - very important 4. Yoga, I've aded in the pigeon pose 5. Lots of abs (not sit-ups, which are bad for the back) - crunches, leg lifts. In the gym I do the Roman Chair and the ab machines almost exclusively right now. Apparently, a strong core is very helpful. 6. I'm adding additional stretches here and there to see what helps. I'm only just over a week out, but my life is slowly returning to normal. I'm on my 2nd day with no meds (20 mg or prednisone and Flexoril). I was able to give up the belt last Thursday. I had a good amount of pain this morning but it was manageable. After my routine I was good. It's now after lunch and I've had very little pain since getting in the car.  I'm very conscious of how I sit, anymore. I don't slouch. I'm still not back to running or doing a heavy workout. I'm moving a little slowly - mostly because I'm careful and a little hesitant. I also lost 8 lbs from not eating and I lost visible tone in my leg in just that 2 weeks. So, it's been a recovery.

c,"Ok so this is a great thread for me. I’ve always had PE, I started taking Zoloft a couple mo the ago and it’s hit or miss, quite literally. It either doesn’t help at all and I cum within a few minutes or it lasts too long and I can’t get off. I hate pharmaceuticals, long story and off subject so won’t dive too far with that. I’d rather take natural plants, herbs, and botanicals. I’ve recently run into a source for shrooms and have some on the way. My wife and I used to take x all the time 15-20 yr ago but we had kids and stopped all that. Recently we’ve been struggling so I suggested x again but we decided not to but want to find a more natural way. We tried blue lotus and the effects of that were ok but nothing like advertised as far as similar to x. I also have to say I take Kratom daily (instead of pills) for back pain, energy and mood. Before this gets too long I really just wanted to ask since I’ve never tried shrooms before. What is the standard “amount” to start off MD? I’m a long time anxious, depressed and probably no polar person. I loath psych’s, for one all they really do these days is rx crap shoot medicines. I have allot of make up to do (in the bedroom) and I want sex enjoyable for both of us. Like I said I’m one extreme to the other on Zoloft and just want to find a happy median. So I’m wondering what would be a good starting dose? I have two 8g chocolate bars coming and I have no idea how much to take. There’s a few reasons why I want to try this. After 18 yrs my wife and I have somewhat drifted from each other. We have allot of stress at work and home as we have a special needs son who is low functioning. As I said above I’ve had PE since the get go. My upbringing wasn’t the best either so I’m most certain there’s allot of lingering issues out there I haven’t dealt with. I actually wasn’t even looking to help PE with mushrooms, the goal was to find something more natural than x to get close to the effects of it with my wife so we might be able to heal the years and become closer than we are now.",0.542962,0.620653,0.6629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28398058252427183

s,"I did get the memo growing up that masturbating is healthy, but I apparently did NOT get the memo that masturbating 3-5 times a day due to covid boredom can cause severe pelvic dysfunction and even UTIs. Let me explain:I'm only 25, but have had mysterious dick and ball pain for almost 2 months even after taking antibiotics to knock out my highly unusual male UTI. The most noticeable lingering symptom was a horrible burning in my urethra after masturbating which would go away on its own after an hour. Only after ruling out every possible case after that, my doctor threw up his hands and asked me how many times a day I orgasm. His mouth was agape when I said 3-5 times due to covid.Apparently, the muscles involved in orgasm don't strengthen from orgasm... only fatigue. So, from orgasming that many times a day, the muscles spasm, inflame, and swell, causing urethritis (inflamed urethra), orchitis (inflamed testicles), lower back pain, and painful urination because the orgasm muscles wrap around your BLADDER and when SWOLLEN can prevent you from fully emptying your urinary tract. Here I am, for two months scared I had some horrible prostate problem that would plague me my whole life, or some sort of chronic bladder condition, but no. I simply jack it way too much because I'm bored at home all day. Two months of suffering for that.

s,"&amp;#x200B;Massage therapy is used to help people control their fitness or improve their overall well-being. It entails handling the body's soft tissues. [**San Diego massage and spa**](https://www.beautykliniek.com/) have been used in most civilizations throughout human history, both Eastern and Western, and was one of the first instruments used to attempt to alleviate discomfort. The word ""massage therapy"" encompasses a wide range of therapies. **Brazilian waxing San Diego** and massage therapy is the most popular form of treatment in Western countries, and it is taught in most massage schools. Sports massage, therapeutic massage for particular purposes such as releasing muscle spasms, and massage traditions originating from Eastern cultures, such as Shiatsu and Tuina, are examples of other types. Massage therapy has been researched for a variety of pain conditions, including low back pain, neck and shoulder pain, knee osteoarthritis pain, and headaches. Several studies of massage for low-back pain have found only poor evidence that it could be beneficial, according to science. Massage therapy may assist with neck and shoulder pain, but the effects will only be temporary. Massage treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee has been shown in trials to have short-term effects of relieving knee pain. Only a few headache massage trials have been conducted. The findings of these trials, which looked at various forms of massage and different types of headaches, were inconsistent. Massage therapy can be a part of preventive treatment for cancer patients who want to try it if they take the necessary precautions; however, the evidence that it can ease pain and anxiety is not good. Massage therapy, with or without aromatherapy (the use of essential oils), has been used to help patients with cancer manage their pain, anxiety, and other symptoms. A 2016 review of 19 trials involving more than 1,200 cancer patients showed some proof that massage may help with pain and anxiety, although the validity of the evidence was poor (most studies were limited, and some may have been biased), and the results were inconsistent. If massage therapy is used for a long time, it can help with certain fibromyalgia symptoms. Massage therapy reduced pain, anxiety, and depression in people with fibromyalgia when used for at least 5 weeks, according to a 2014 review of 9 trials (404 total participants). It has little effect on sleep disruption. In a 2015 review of 10 trials with a total of 478 patients, the outcomes of various types of massage therapy were compared, and the majority of forms of massage were found to improve the quality of life in people with fibromyalgia. Swedish massage may be an exception; two trials (with a total of 56 participants) found no benefits. There is some evidence that massage therapy can help patients with HIV/AIDS with anxiety, depression, and quality of life, but the amount of study and people tested are limited. Premature babies that are massaged have been shown to gain weight more quickly. Massage has not been seen to offer any clear effects for normal full-term babies.

c,"Going vegan has not been shown to be healthier than eating a healthy diet including meat. What has been seen in studies is a confounding effect.  When people who eat the SAD (Standard American Diet) what to make a change and improve their health they don't just do one thing, they improve multiple factors at the same time. They drop excess sugars, switch to lower GI foods, increase the variety of vegetables, drop fast food, increase exercise, and so on. When they do all these things you are left with a person with improved stats, showing that something they did worked, but not which thing. Maybe dropping sugar was the biggest contributor, or increasing exercise, but going vegan has not been shown by this study to be good, it has been suggested.

The height of your eyes is where the top of your monitor goes. Between these two you should be looking directly forward and typing at a comfortable height.

c,"I wrote a few pieces on this! Here is what matters when considering a new office chair as it relates to back pain (according to my mom who is a **licensed PT** in Kentucky). **The actual seat pan tilts forward:** Of all the actual so-called features, this one is perhaps the biggest non-negotiable. You need to be able to tilt forward the actual angle of what you are sitting upon in order to properly execute the “Home Base” position of sitting on the edge of the seat. In this position, your knees are below your pelvis and you are sitting on the edge of the seat. NOTE: the ability to tilt the seat forward can also help reduce the knee pain that you often feel during long bouts of sitting. How does it do that? The angle of the chair better aligns your whole leg so that your patella tendon isn’t pressed against the back of your kneecap with the same amount of force. **Solid lumbar support:** This will allow you to sit with your knees at the same level as your pelvis but with your back resting against your lumbar support. Ideally, the lumbar support is independently adjustable from the backrest. But it’s also fine if the lumbar support is adjustable insofar as it can move up and down with the backrest. **Ability to sit in multiple positions:** You CANNOT stay in one position all day.. So, besides supporting the two “home base” sitting positions, your desk chair needs to be able to support general adjustments in how you are sitting throughout the day. Side note: that’s the problem with rigid desks: you typically can’t raise your chair and sit underneath it. **Adjustable armrests:** it’s important to be able to rest your arms or have them share the load throughout the day. So, armrests are a good thing. But, they need to be at an appropriate height and width from your shoulders so that you aren’t forced to slouch when using them. It’s also important that they are adjustable so that you can roll your chair close to the desk and have the chair be able to go under the desk surface. **High maximum seat height:** you’ll want to be able to adjust your chair height — that’s a given. But, your seat being able to go high enough so that your pelvis can be at or above your knees is not a given. At a minimum, your chair should have a max seat height of 20 inches. **Non-mesh or high quality material:** like a mattress, you don’t want your chair to lose its support and sag over time. Unless it is very well-made, mesh material in the seat of the chair can be a cause for concern as it often stretches over time. Mesh material for the backrest is a bit less concerning so long as there is a good lumbar support and/or the mesh is likewise high quality. **Reconsider high-back and “Executive” chairs:** high backs and so-called “Executive” chairs are not good choices because they will keep you from your often subconscious back-arching (i.e. back extensions) and stretching throughout the day. That kind of stretching is like a natural, mini-antidote to a bulging disk as it helps take pressure off the walls of your spinal disks! High backs can also be detrimental in that they often encourage slouching back into the chair rather than proper posture. **Avoid or remove headrests:** it’s generally a good idea to avoid headrests for all the same reasons that you should reconsider high-back chairs: they encourage slouching and prevent back/neck extensions. In addition to those reasons, headrests frequently push your neck forward and improperly round your shoulders.

For example I got a severe kidney infection (had severe back pain that came on suddenly) after a UTI and I had two nurses and two doctors in one hospital tell me I was just experiencing anxiety. I had a friend drive me to another hospital where I was immediately seen and diagnosed with this infection, had to take antibiotics for a couple of weeks and was fine. Doctor said if I hadn't gone to the second hospital I'd have had serious permanent kidney damage.  I once had an asthma attack, taken to hospital for help as I couldn't breathe, and a GP threw a salbutamol (blue inhaler) at me and said to go home and ""sleep it off"" and that I was just ""anxious"". I had to see a private doctor the next day who gave me steroid tablets and I had a chest infection (got my lungs x-rayed).  As for mental health, yeah it's even worse. It's SO bad.

Neck and back pain is fucking awful this morning, but I think that's because I skipped my night dose yesterday. I got a new shipment of kratom around 6, dosed then, but by 10 I had a terrible headache, so I decided to just go to bed.

That said, everyone in the group chat was praising this batch so I just had to get it. I also don't think this is like normal ""reds"" which are made via fermentation, Benni grows some of his own kratom so I believe this is one of those rare times a vendor is actually basing the color off the vein color. On the site iy says it's non-fermented, so I think it will be less dull than typical reds. 11- Super relaxing batch, I could almost take a nap, really considering it honestly, didn't sleep much last night. This batch is better than most reds but I still feel as though greens and whites are your best bet if you're after euphoria and even anxiety reduction. When it comes to vein color red is when the tree is at it's earliest stages, so I think that whether the red name comes from fermentation or vein color at the time harvest, greens and whites will always be stronger. This is amazing for a solo red though, I'm very excited to blend this with my greens and whites. 11:20- I am so tired, wow, this is one of the most sedating batches I've ever had. This will be absolutely perfect to blend with whites. No nausea whatsoever, I think after I try the new strains I got alone I'll blend this with the white MD I got. Very sedating and relaxing strain, but like every other red I've tried, I think I'll be using this purely for blending. This would add a ton of depth to a blend with whites or greens, or all three.

I was about due for a new pair anyway, so I headed to the local running store. I asked for my brand, but they were fresh out of my size. The clerk sized me, watched me walk and had me stand barefoot. “Holy Smokes! You've got no arch!” He said.“Yes,” I responded. “I know my shoe is not designed for flat-footed folks, but it works for me. I've run two half marathons using it and had no issues, no foot pain, no knee pain, no back pain.”I walked out of the store with a pair shoes made for flat feet, brimming with arch support.  They felt comfortable walking around the store and the clerk seemed to know what he was talking about. I took them home, ran 10 miles and could barely walk after. They felt great on my left foot but killed my right foot. I chalked it up to running a little too far in a new pair of shoes and decided to give it another week.

c,"I know exactly what you are talking about. I've been trying Weight Watchers for 2 years and 3 months now. At my heaviest I was 406. At my lightest, I got down to 355. I've slowly put the weight back on, and had weeks where it came off, see-sawing all over the place. I am currently back at 390.6, but I have lost 5.2lbs over the last two weeks. For me the hardest change is going to smaller and more controlled portions. I have always been able to *eat*. Like, pack away 2lbs of steak, plus potatoes, cola, corn, etc. I ate four people's worth of serving sizes at meals nearly all the time. I still do sometimes. I was *hungry*, and it just wouldn't stop even when I would eat slow, or try to load up on protein, or have multiple smaller snack sized meals per day, etc. Quite honestly, not a fucking thing I have tried has truly worked there in the past. I also suffered from severe depression during the last three years, mainly stemming from when I lost my job, girlfriend, and home all in a lovely one week stretch of 2010 about 3 months after my Grandfather died.

It's a gradual thing, but I'd like to think that the last two weeks show me making some progress. I'm not restricting my diet or really counting calories yet, but I am making an effort to eat less. It's just a bitch to fight yourself, and your life long habits, but I am sick and tired of all of it. I am tired of my poor self-imagine, I am tired of clothing shopping being such a pain, and worst of all, I am tired of my back pain. I used to never have back pain, and in the last two years my back has just gotten unbearably painful. Standing hurts. Walking hurts. Rolling over in bed fucking hurts. The only thing that doesn't hurt is sitting. It's pathetic. I used to build homes with my Father and nowadays I can barely walk. That is by far my biggest motivation to change. I just want the pain to stop so I can feel normal again. So that I can stop feeling trapped by my weight and my poor habits. Seeing that people like you have done it gives me hope that I can finally get it done. I'm tired of carrying around two people all the time.",0.0,0.677923,0.751299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24898785425101214

Aside from the fact that this current pandemic has really impacted my daily life, the following all happened to me THIS YEAR!1.) After a period in which I was bed ridden for two days after I had badly pulled a muscle in my calf back in February, I have been struggling with sciatica ever since... Which makes work and pretty much doing anything hell... 2.) 2020 was also the year in which I befriended this person who I thought was my friend, he gained my trust, but he turned out to be a cross-dressing methhead who actually smoked meth in my house while I was at work. Like, I came home to finding the place smelling like aerosol, and he then charged at me with my lightsaber*, while wearing a woman's dress... I had to call HIS MOTHER to get him. It was ridiculous! He then tried to stalk me at my work... and failed. The whole entire story is a whole another post in and of itself... I posted about it in the OG sub r/Doomers in the week right when it went into quarantine before one of the mods went totally insane...3.) 2020 is also the year in which my self-awareness has increased, and I have struggled with increased levels on insights on as to why I am such a hateful little demon... This is the year in which I turned 26, making me realize that ten years ago... I was a totally different person. Fucked up back then... and far, far worse now... This is why autism is truly toxic... Trust me... I know this from experience...The remainder of this year is not going to go well for me. I get more agitated and depressed, from melancholic, to volatile, to stressed, to apathetic CONSTANTLY during the cold season, ESPECIALLY with daylight savings time...At the very least I should say thank you to my small inner circle of friends that I hang with in real life as well as this sub. At least you guys get it...Overall however, in regards to how shitty 2020 has been for the most part; fuck off and good riddance... 🖕",0.0,0.627624,0.0,0.0,0.648053,0.0,0.0,0.2776349614395887

s,"This all started about 2 months ago. Suddenly the joints in my legs along with my thighs, hamstrings, calves, and feet became gradually painful, like a dully/ burning type of pain. For about a month this pain will alternate different sections of my legs but it always remain bilateral.About 4 months ago I had back surgery, l5 s1 microdiscectomy laminectomy. My Surgeon and PC Doc thought these symptoms were related to this so they order a MRI and EMG. Both tests came back clean. Then about a month later, my body started to feel weak, almost fatigue like, no energy whatsoever, with dry month, congested ear, blood in urine, and anemia that would come go. Doc thought it might’ve been the medicine I was taking, however nonetheless, order a blood test. Blood work came back clean. Now, I’m still dealing with ongoing symptoms. It still mostly consist of bilateral leg/ joint pain that goes down to the toes, a congested ear, and moderate hip/ low back pain. The pain is still achy/ burning, especially at the joints. I have problems walking/ sitting longer than 30 mins. And I also have a bad heat intolerance, almost if I lost sensation of the cold? I had a hip X Ray done yesterday that showed problems with my hips, doc thinks it can be either SI joints or FAI.

As for everyone giving the whole ""boxing is anaerobic"" spiel, oh my lord, we get it. You frequent bodybuilding.com every once in awhile. The fact is, all the greats ran for time/distance, and you should be too. Why? Because the anaerobic part of boxing is just that- the boxing part. You're getting all of the anaerobic work you could ever possibly need through bag work, sparring, mitts, skipping, etc., and running is your chance to work on a different, longer lasting, and more restorative energy system. If you want intervals, structure your run like you would a round: Run a half mile in 3 minutes, slow to a jogging pace for one minute, and then pick it up again.  Otherwise, just run for time. If you're out there and you just put 30 minutes on the clock, all you have to do is go- as time goes on, you're going to get faster, and the entire experience will be more enjoyable. Thinking ""I've got to run X miles in Y pace today"" is ridiculous, and counter productive.  Running is complementary to your sport, to improve general conditioning, not turn you into an Iron Man competitor. Treat it as such. ",0.565243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3025830258302583
s,"It all started with back pain, dad would ask me to give him a massage with a rhumatisme cream that his doctor prescribed for him. 2 whole weeks of this and still he didn't get better, instead he got thinner and unable to eat, me and my mother tried to feed him but he kept refusing and so we took him to a clinic, he got diagnosed with lung cancer, metastasis to be exact, in all his organs, his lab results were awful too, in other words it was too late to try saving him, he stayed in the clinic for 3 days. On the last day he started having trouble breathing so they put him on an oxygen pump. We brought him home on the 4th day around 12pm. Neither he nor my mother slept that night because it was too difficult for him to breath so he had to constantly sit up and of course mom held him the whole night.

No!"" only then did I realize he wasn't breathing anymore, his eyes and mouth were wide open.

c,"My son was born with tethered spinal cord syndrome which is in the family of neural tube birth defects. No warning whatsoever, no family history, healthy pregnancy. Just a random fluke. I think the stats on it are like 1 in 100,000 kids are born with it. In almost 13 years, I've never met anyone else who has it or has a kid with it.  Basically, my son has a benign tumor in his lower back that fused to his spinal cord when he was a wee fetus. He has a telltale hole at the top of his butt crack where the tumor pulled the skin in as well (it's called a sacral dimple). He had surgery at 5 months old to release the tumor from the cord and shrink the tumor as much as possible. They can't remove it without risking a stroke. We were told that if he reached 5yo without it retethering the chances of it being a problem again would be something like 5-10%. Lo and behold, he started having problems (limping, back pain, able to see the tumor changing size/shape) at age 9 so he went through a second surgery.  The surgeries are incredibly intense. It involves taking apart vertebrae, dissecting the tumor from the spinal cord, and putting everything back together. He has to be immobilized in the hospital for a week afterward on his stomach (mostly to prevent spinal fluid leaks) and then at home on bedrest for several weeks afterward. The last time he was out of school for a month. The last time, they also accidentally severed a nerve so he woke up screaming with nerve pain in one leg. The repercussions of having the tumor pulling on the spinal cord is progressive nerve damage to the lower body. Even though we caught it early, my son has fairly significant nerve damage to his bladder and sphincter. Sometimes he is incontinent and wears adult diapers when he needs to. He really takes that like a champ and with far better humor than most adults I know. At this point, it's almost a given that it will retether again before he stops growing. He's coming up on 13 now and hitting those crazy horomonal growth spurts. He knows it's just a matter of time but doesn't dwell on it. I try not to either for that matter. It just is what it is on our lives. We're also just finding out he has Sever's Disease which, in and of itself, isn't terribly uncommon but his seems to be caused by extremely tight legs muscles. I suspect the two things are connected but the jury is out until we see his neurosurgeon again. He starts physical therapy next week and I'm keeping my fingers crossed  that it helps the leg and joint issue. It's hard as a parent to watch your kid deal with things like pain and incontinence but at the same time I'm so proud of him for the maturity amd dignity he shows throughout it all.

I guess I must be a ""spoonie"" also.  I was an STNA several years ago until I got hurt. I worked mainly with the elderly and I LOVED that job. No matter how stressful it was, I loved my patients! There were a few times I was there holding someone's hand in their last moment when they had no family there. I'd brush or comb their hair easy, talk to them gently, and let them know it was okay to go. I made sure all my patients I took care of felt like they were heard and how I was willing to do whatever to help them.  I took one patient's clothes home over night at the end of my shift and stayed up til 3 am mending them by hand. One lady had extremely dry hands that frustrated her and made her cry. I made a bottle of sugar scrub (just mainly sugar and olive oil...no scents because of meds, rules, etc). I showed her how to use it the next day and she cried again...because her hands finally felt some relief. I continued to make it for her even after I left that job up until she passed away.

c,"So sorry I just now saw this! My doctor said the nerve pain was normal as the nerve has shortened and it will just take time to stretch back out (I have been stretching a lot and it helps tons). He also said the back pain from over doing it was normal. It has slowly gotten better and better and I'm feeling more and more like my old self. The nerve pain is just really short twinges maybe once or twice a day. The sore lower back probably happens once or twice a week. It really just depends on how often I stretch and what I do each day.  I'm a stay at home mom, so no job to return to, but I've been able to resume our normal activities and then some. My son is almost 2 and about 30 lbs, I try not to lift him, but am able to easily when I need to. I go to the gym 4-5 days a week. I started with just walking. Now I run most of the time. I'm not super fast, but I am in the best shape of my life. I also added in weights after 3 months post op. Super low to start and I don't do anything too heavy to avoid injury. I started eating better and have lost weight which I believe has helped as well. (I've always been overweight, working hard to change that now, the surgery was a big motivator to finally lose the weight)  Walking for long periods of time is fine, but standing does tend to aggravate my low back more. Proper shoes are important, I've noticed I do much worse if I chose shoes that are flat-soled. Hope this helps!

c,"Re: your example. I have an 8 inch Santoku knife and a 4 inch paring knife. They can do all the tasks I normally need and make cooking easier because I have tools that fit the jobs I do most often.  Before my current 8 inch knife, I had a flimsy 8 inch cheapy knife that was difficult to use (actually cut myself a few times because the blade never stayed sharp enough and required a lot of force to cut through....tomato skin). If you do a lot of cooking, it's worth getting tools that can make cooking more enjoyable and safer.  For other things, I think about how much time it could save me by buying a multi-tasker item. How much would it improve my life? For example, I bought a new pair of sneakers because the old pair was wearing down and not giving me enough walking support. With COVID, I also work from home and needed an ergonomic work station so I bought a standing desk converter to alleviate back pain. It was either a new chair or standing desk converter.

Good job, keep it up! &gt;Anyone else experienced this and do you have any tips on managing/surviving? Am I doing the jogging too fast or is it the added hills (just going on a creek trail, dont have access to a track)? Slow down. Do it. Control your breathing. You won't believe how better it'll be if you do. It keeps you focused on it and forces you to go on. I find myself comfortable with a two-step rhythm. Try to use a multiple of two, so either two or four (if you can do it in six steps, i think you have lungs the size of Texas). Good shoes and good socks. If you're running on a trail, you may look into trail running shoes (they're usually higher on the ankle to avoid spraining them). Watch your stance. Heads up, look ahead of you, try to run on the forefoot. This will also prevent back pain. &gt;Also changed up the times I do it, due to life. Previously was 4pm after work, now its 6am.

c,"With regards to your back pain, it sounds like muscle tension in your lower back or some form of sciatica (irritation of the sciatic nerve). If it is sciatica, it might not be your back that is problem. Sometimes tightness in your glutes and hamstrings and cause irritation of the sciatic nerve, causing you to feel pain in your lower back.  I would definitely recommend trying yoga. Something gentle and slow like a beginner hatha class or a yin class will help you work on stretching  gradually and improve the flexibility in your spine. An iyengar class could also be beneficial, as the use of yoga blocks, straps, and cushions can be helpful for safe, gradual stretching and allow you to focus on proper spinal alignment in the stretches. As for your routine, while I understand your PT's concern, smith machine is got going to help. As nanochic said, you're not able to perform squats in a natural motion when you're using the smith machine and you'd be better off doing front squats to take the stress off of your back. Same goes for the bench press. If the bar alone is too heavy (45 lbs, which I think is about 20kg) for you to do a regular barbell bench press, maybe try doing dumbbell bench presses. This will at least allow you to use the stabilizing muscles in your chest and shoulders, which the smith machine doesn't allow you to do. The number of reps you're doing is fine. Though if you're able to make it through all three sets at 12 reps each, you could probably stand to increase the weight.",0.520438,0.609949,0.857637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2673992673992674

c,"Hey, I'm sorry you're in so much pain! I had a similar experience with sciatica. I was extremely nauseous during ovulation and period week and was in pain strong enough to make me limp all day everyday.  I saw several OB/GYN's and they all said, get some rest and take an ibuprofen. One day it was too much and I collapsed at home alone. I had a fun ambulance ride and the ER doctor told me it was sciatica (after 3 pregnancy tests) and to go home and rest. I was distraught as I was fairly convinced that sciatica did not cause vomiting and the intense pelvic pain I felt. Six months later, after an MRI by the 10th doctor I had seen, I found out I had a very herniated disc. I went through months of PT and one full month bed rest. I could walk normally again, but the pain did not go away.  I was still vomiting 2 weeks per month, barely keeping down ginger ale and toast. Saw three more OB/GYN's and the fourth one said, hmm, ok, let's have a look. He did excision surgery that lasted ca. 4 hours. When I came out of the operating room he told me there were adhesions and small cysts everywhere, especially on the uteral sacral ligaments that sit behind the uterus. Apparently these were capable of causing shooting pain down to my toes. Post-excision I felt much better for about 6 months. Unfortunately it seems the endo has grown back with a vengeance. My pain is always terrible on the left side, but the endo is also more present on the right side of my body. Referred pain is real and confusing.  I have tried 5-6 different kinds of BC pill (lost count) and never managed longer than a month with any of them. I threw up everything and they caused terrible migraines and depression. I had 2 IUD's as the first one moved and got implanted in the muscle wall and had to be surgically removed. The second had similar effects to the pill. So I would check with your doctor to see if you can try a different one (or leave it altogether if you are TTC). All of the specialists I have seen told me it would be easier to get pregnant right after a lap. Well, due to the time it took to find a good doctor and the scar tissue from 4 surgeries, the endo destroyed my egg reserve and now even IVF is out of the question. I don't want to scare you, but just wanted to say that if pregnancy is something you really want, it is imperative you find a good GYN/surgeon that you trust. Wishing you lots of luck and pain relief! Feel free to message me if you want to chat. TL;DR- it's totally possible you have a structural issue (sciatica, tight muscles, etc) and endo. The only way to find out if the endo is the culprit is to have a lap/excision surgery by a knowledgeable doctor.

s,"I thought about posting this a few days ago, but decided to wait until this day, since it was Halo 3 that truly introduced me to Halo in general. I'd like to start this post by saying the Halo community, from my old days as a Senior Mythic Member on Bungie.net, to now, on reddit, has been my life blood, and one of the many reasons I'm here today. I'll explain that in a minute. But I want you all to know this post comes out of love, and a massive appreciation for this game, and the community who helped me through the darkest time of my life. There will be a tl;dr at the bottom, but please try to read the whole thing. I apologize for the Flood Wall of text.Back in 2006, I was over at a friends house, playing some games. Guitar Hero and the Dead Rising demo. When he asked if I had ever played Halo. I wasn't much of an Xbox kid, but he was introducing me to the system, and I was loving it so far. Gamecube for life, I thought. He pulled up the menu and found the downloaded file of the[Halo 3 announcement trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXrYSEOg3Ro). As I watched it, hearing the musical notes hitting at just the right time, seeing those gorgeous graphics, and finally seeing the man himself, John 117, the Master Chief, it just hit me. Hard. Like, I'm pretty sure my 16 year old self got aroused watching that trailer. It was everything to me. I ended up getting an Xbox 360 the next day, and buying Halo: Combat Evolved. As I played through the game, seeing Halo and being dumbfounded, and fighting the Covenant, and surviving the Flood, I truly felt powerful. Then came Halo 2. I bought the collectors edition brand new off eBay, and began an even greater journey. I would end up playing the campaign alone, over and over and over again. Then the day I had been waiting for. Halo 3. Finally, I could finish the fight. On September 25, 2007, I finally had Halo 3: Legendary Edition. It was everything I could have hoped it would be. Just walking through Valhalla, and playing the stunning and beautiful campaign, I was blown away. I was so happy to finally have this in my life.Fast forward to January 8th, 2008. I was driving home from work, on my way to get online with a few friends for a tournament we set up for Team Slayer. I was super pumped. As I was driving under the interstate, a car came flying off the exit ramp, slamming into the passenger side of my car, forcing me over the median, and into oncoming traffic. I was injured badly. My back was fractured in three places, and I had chips in two other vertebrae. I had a bad concussion, bad burns from the airbag, and severe whiplash. This was 22 days before my 18th birthday. I spent it in a back brace. I couldn't even tie my own shoes. I was helpless.For an entire year, I was in physical therapy, having my parents and little brother help with menial things, like shoe tying, picking up clothes off the floor, or just helping me fix something to eat. My ""friends"" ended up abandoning me, as I was no longer fun to be around. I couldn't go to the gym anymore, so I lost muscle and gained fat back. I fell into horrible depression that, because of medical reasons, I could not treat. I wanted nothing more than the pain and the suffering to end. I couldn't take it anymore. I had lost everything. I had the knife in my hand, ready to just end it (Literally and figuratively).I had mentioned what was happening to a couple guys on Halo 3, and they expressed their concerns and sympathies and offered to help me. We ended up playing every day, for about 8 hours a day. We got damn good at Halo 3. Halo 3 took my mind off the pain, and emotional stress I was going through. The community helped me forget about the people who abandoned me. When no one else seemed to care, or help, the community of Halo was there.Through 2008, I ended up getting out of my depression, and focusing on the one thing that made me happy; Halo 3. Thanks to this game, and this community, I was able to overcome severe depression, suicidal thoughts and desires, and eventually the pain of a broken body. Now, in 2017, as we celebrate the 10 year anniversary of one of the greatest video games ever made, I can confidently say without a doubt, Halo 3, and the community it created, saved my life. I am now back to normal (although I will have back pain for the rest of my life), married to a wonderful girl, and excelling at my work. All because of a video game, and some random strangers on the internet. It because of you all, every one of you, that keeps people like me going. The shared love of a game that came out a decade ago is something to be admired. I will never forget what this game has done for me, and in an earlier post I made which can be [seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/6ubb5q/wanted_to_share_a_very_small_portion_of_my/), I really fucking love Halo 3. I owe a lot to Bungie and to the Bnet community for the help they gave me, and for showing me I can push through the toughest of life's misfortunes, because there will always be someone there to lift you up. I love each and every one of you, and know our shared love of a franchise is something we can all bond over. As I look back after ten years to a fight we finished hundreds of times, I am truly thankful for you all, and for this amazing game. Thank you all. tl;dr Halo 3 saved me from killing myself, and it's all thanks to the amazing community it created.",0.621199,0.622863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17162698412698413
c,"I have a lot of thoughts on this. First, that surgeon you saw is rude and does not have your best interest in mind so absolutely find a new one. Reductions are often a ""medical"" procedure rather than a ""cosmetic"" procedure because associated symptoms like back pain/neck pain/rashes/etc. I'm assuming he meant it would be hard to make a case to get insurance to cover it because your boobs aren't ""as large"" as other peoples are? This is a somewhat fair statement.  I have 32DDD (but most likely G+ boobs) and my surgeon said something similar (basically that i may be a ""boderline case for insurance"" due to my size) but he did not mention anything about mother nature doing a good job/etc. Basically, your surgeon was saying you have nice big boobs that other people would want and he doesn't think they need to be reduced. However, he is a plastic surgeon who is supposed to perform surgeries that his patients want him to. I'm guessing 90% of his procedures are purely cosmetic (ie. augmentations, body sculpting, lipo, facial injections, etc, etc). He would never say something like that to someone who wants to get an augmentation and go from a smaller cup size to a D/DD. There is nothing wrong with getting a reduction just to feel more comfortable with your body if that is what you want to do. Whether insurance will cover it is another story because insurance companies are evil - but I digress.  &amp;#x200B; I think if you want to get a reduction and it would improve your confidence/self esteem/other issues wether physical or mental, then you should absolutely do it. I am also 22 and have a similar size to you and my main reason is more cosmetic - I hate the way I look and feel in clothes with how big my chest is. I do also have back pain and other symptoms but what brought me to this subreddit/the idea of finally getting a reduction was the more mental aspect of it because I just feel so uncomfortable in my skin all the time. Don't let one surgeon's sexist comment get you down. (Also I would report/leave a review with the quote he said because it was quite sexist and unprofessional).  &amp;#x200B; If you want a reduction GO FOR IT.

s,"https://imgur.com/a/6EFg42xTL;DR: out of curiosity I’m opening bins from 6+ years ago, only to find I’ve got a ‘brand new’ wardrobe!I hope I did the Imgur thing right.So July of 2017 I was at my heaviest ever, having gained a bunch of weight after losing a parent (in 2012) and going into a depression spiral for the next 6 years. Not working (semi retired) made it easier to hide from life. Living alone didn’t help, because there was no one to ‘push’ me to engage. Not cooking for myself, which was once a passion, drove me to fast food. (I’ve since reintroduced myself to the joys of cooking). Not engaging in life, I slowly regressed into a heavy mid 40’s hermit, after having the time of my life for literally decades prior. It was a drastic change. In those years of living alone in my depressed transformation, I didn’t see family or friends. I chose to go out only at night for necessities. Living in the low desert, it was pretty hot during the day much of the year, and being heavy (and uncomfortable being seen in that skin), that made it easier to hide, effectively cutting myself off even *more* from  any unnecessary human contact. Less chance of running into friends I hadn’t seen in awhile, when I’d go shopping at midnight. 🙄Anyway, when I started tracking CICO September 2018 (@ 210 pounds), without really knowing what my macros were supposed to be (or even what a macro *was*), I started dropping weight rather effortlessly. It was amazing. I was on a constant high from the renewed energy. But I’d developed some pretty debilitating back pain somewhere in the last 5 years (weight related? I seemed fine pre-weight gain, for the most part). Unable to stand without extreme effort on the part of my arms and wrists to help push myself up out of bed every day. Or out of chairs, when seated. My wrists were starting to wear out on me, from all the daily pressure on them. I was really going downhill. Fast. CICO was obviously working, but I wanted more. I started looking into the Keto WOE, mainly for anti inflammatory purposes, but I was also hoping to benefit from the other aspects of Keto as well (clarity, reducing random and rampant hunger, and of course weight loss). After going lower carb (mostly under 100) and CICO for all of September and October, in early November 2018 I finally took the plunge...trying to work out the right fat/protein macros, but staying at 20 or less, tracking every single bite with the most accurate data I could find, using MFP (accuracy with MFP as we all know is sometimes a challenge, but it can be done). Finally understanding about %ages (not necessary to focus on) vs grams (of which I’ve become obsessed). Realizing that I do not need alllllll the bars, the shakes, the clear protein drinks that I’d initially stocked WAY up on (to have readily available protein sources on hand). (Silly me, now I keep a tray of b/s chicken thighs in the fridge at all times that can be snacked on at any time, or turned into all sorts of incredible meal ideas...ty, G Hughes!!) It wasn’t long after starting Keto, maybe it was by Christmas? that I realized, my body was no longer in constant pain. Anyway, fast forward to today. I spend most of the year out of state (1800 miles away). Monday night I returned home after being gone since January. I’d only recently realized that I was really down quite a bit of weight (nothing of mine fit anymore, so I was supplementing my lack of wardrobe with the occasional Goodwill finds until I could return home). In the 5 months since I’d been gone, I’m down about 20 more pounds (I was 171 in January), but the last two months I stabilized at 152, mainly because I’ve been eating at (even over) maintenance since April. I still didn’t recognize the changes in my body yet. Well. I’m home now, and today I pulled my most accessible bin from the top of my closet, which just so happens to hold a bunch of outfits, all shorts and shirts I used to wear when I’d play tennis. Perfect, since it’s warm out in Southern California, and I’m in desperate need of some decent shorts and shirts that fit. Guys!!!!! They allllllllll FIT!!!! This is like the best shopping trip EVER!! All my old favorites. It’s as though that last 6-7 year never happened. I knew I was coming along, but until today, I had no idea how far. Thanks to this sub, from the all stories I’ve read and the knowledge I’ve gained, has been indispensable. When I last wore these, I was admittedly 24# heavier (it was all muscle @ 176) than my current weight (152).

A couple days later, I went to the gym and was doing some bent over barbell rows. On the last rep, I went to rerack the bar and the pain came back just as bad. I stood up straight and straightened out my lower back and it was gone instantly. Like completely gone. So, again, I thought nothing of it. A couple days later, after a couple days of running and stretching, I was working out chest. I was on an incline bench with the proper slight arch in the lower back (scapula retracted, shoulders back) lifting two small thirty pound dumbbells when as soon as I arched my back a tiny bit the pain came back. I almost dropped the weights on my head. I wasn’t able to get off the bench for a solid five minutes. As soon as I got home I just laid flat on the ground because this time the pain wasn’t going away as fast. I wasn’t sure what it was but for the past week I have done no physical exercise to try and rest. Today, I tried stretching my lower back to see if it would help the process of healing. As soon as I reached for my toes the pain came back worse than ever before. It felt like someone was stabbing me right in between my lower back and hips. This time it wasn’t disappearing as fast either. The pain is mostly in my lower back (about as low on the back as you can go) and radiating down into my buttocks but it is nowhere else. It is extremely debilitating. Additionally, I can run just fine with it. The only thing it is stopping me from doing is lifting weights or arching it for literally anything. A simple sitting on the floor and touching your toes stretch gave me the worst back pain i’ve ever felt. It doesn’t hurt to the touch and doesn’t look bruised either. If anyone can help me out please that would be awesome....Semper Fi",0.0,0.65286,0.831284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27293064876957496

I never get heartburn (unless I ate peppers or something) and I started getting heartburn at 7DPO. Other than that it was all non-specific: bloating, backache, gassy. 9DPO I woke up with my vaginal walls being very... puffy. I kinda had to move them out of the way to check my cervix (high, firm, closed). It lasted until I woke up at 10DPO. It felt like I have a cottonball in my vagina or something.

c,"I can’t tell you guys how much I appreciate this subreddit. You are all such witty, strong, beautiful women and I’m very grateful for your stories and support. I will likely lurk around here and there. I wish you all the best of luck with your journeys to parenthood.   So on Sunday night (3/12, 39+6), I was having a little pity party. Baby dropped low for 4 weeks now and I was completely miserable. I was barely sleeping and in a lot of pain from SPD.  Everyone said I’d go early because I started dilating and effacing at 36 weeks….and then stalled. By my 39-week appointment, I was scheduled for a NST and follow up appointment on 3/14 (40+1) with a plan to reevaluate and schedule an induction for week 41. But with a huge nor’easter scheduled to hit us that day, I was really afraid of going into labor and giving birth on the side of the road. I had been drinking red raspberry leaf tea, eating dates/spicy food/pineapple/eggplant parm, having awkward 3rd trimester sex, using my breast pump, bouncing on a yoga ball, taking evening primrose oil - all that shit for weeks! I was completely over it. I just wanted to meet our daughter. By Sunday night, I had resorted to begging LO to come out.  DH went to bed early so he could go to work the next morning. I had wrapped up my last day before maternity leave the previous Friday, so I stayed up a little later. I ended up watching some birth vlogs and got really weepy. I noticed some back pain through the evening, but I’m really no stranger to it, having herniated discs and pregnancy-induced SPD. I went to bed around midnight, convinced that spontaneous labor wouldn’t happen and that I should embrace the idea of being induced.  I woke up around 2 in the morning with back cramps.  I started timing them, thinking it’d be another false alarm, as I had experienced that shit for a good 2 weeks.  But after timing for 45 minutes, I realized I was breathing through them and that they were 50-60 seconds long and coming every 6-7 minutes. I woke DH up and he rubbed my back while I labored in bed for another hour. They weren’t letting up, so I called the hospital to see what they thought.  The on call doctor suggested that we go to L&amp;D.  We grabbed some last minute items, added them to our hospital bag and left. I was in pretty good spirits, and continued to time the contractions during the 45 minute drive. I was hopeful that this was the real deal, but I didn’t feel as bad as I thought I should. There was a part of me that was convinced they were just going to send us home. We got to the hospital around 4:30 am. We got all checked into a room, and at my first check, I was only at 2 cm. They had us walk the hallways for an hour, and checked again - 3 cm. They admitted us around 6:15 and encouraged me to walk more. DH and I must have walked a good 2 miles that morning.  By 8:30, I was at 4 cm.  Progress! But my contractions were pretty irregular - I’d get 2-3 in a row, and then none for 5 minutes.  My cervix doing it’s job, but the irregularity of the contractions made the staff concerned that they could stall. I continued to walk in the halls, but between the contractions, SPD pain, and swollen feet, I was over it. I knew I wanted an epidural and wanted to make sure that I could hold still for it to be placed. So at 11:15, after about 9 hours of labor, I got an epidural.  I was super nervous about getting a giant needle in my back (especially since DH couldn’t stay with me), but my nurse, Kelly, talked me through it and kept me distracted.  The injection that numbed my back pinched and while the epidural itself didn’t hurt, the pressure was pretty unpleasant.  But it was over in 15 minutes (10 of those being for prep alone) and DH was allowed back into the room. It took effect in about 15 minutes and it was great. I could still move my legs, but my contractions only felt like Braxton Hicks, if I felt them at all!  Our doctor met with us just before 12, and explained that my contractions were still in an odd pattern. She offered to break my water to see how things went, and that if they didn’t pick up, she’d introduce a little Pitocin. We agreed with this plan and she broke my water, but of course, I didn’t feel it. After about 10 minutes, I started getting nauseated. Pitocin was started around 12:30 pm. My dad visited about an hour later to wish us well, and in hindsight, I really wish I used this time to nap. But I really thought I had time to work with.  I was a little on the loopy side - maybe 3 glasses of wine deep sort of feeling, which I wasn’t anticipating with an epidural. Shortly after my dad left, I noticed some breakthrough cramping, which I attributed to the Pitocin. But within a half hour, I was in a lot of pain - to the point where I was questioning if the epidural was failing. They were able to introduce a bolus, but it really didn’t help. At this point, my legs were very numb but my lower abdomen was not. The nurses planned to give the bolus a little extra time to work, and if it didn’t, that they’d call anesthesia back to see what the issue was (I have since heard from others that transition just sucks this way, epidural or not). I used a peanut ball to help get things moving a little more and just before switching sides to try to evenly distribute the additional epidural, they decided to check my cervix. I was told it was time to start pushing (3:45 pm)! I knew I felt some pressure, but I had no idea that I was that close to actually delivering my baby! DH said the color drained from my face. I was completely overwhelmed with anticipation and fear. The bottom of the bed was removed and my legs were placed in stirrups.  Pushing was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. It was completely physically and emotionally draining. I didn’t know how long it would go on, considering I’ve heard of FTMs pushing for 2-3 hours. My nurse and DH were so encouraging, which helped. After every few contractions or so, Kelly would adjust the heart monitor for beeb, and it point out how much lower it was getting. After about an hour in, the doctor was called. They brought in a cart and everyone donned surgical gowns. Shit was getting real! As LO made her way lower and lower, the pain didn’t really let up between contractions. But at least I knew that the end was near. At 5:08 pm, the doctor said, “Look down and meet your daughter” - and Emilia Rae was born. She screamed once but was otherwise quiet and alert. She stared intently at both of us, clearly recognizing our voices, which was probably the coolest part of the whole experience. They placed her on my chest immediately and we toweled her off while DH cut the umbilical cord. I was totally captivated by her big blue eyes. They stitched me up while we had our “golden hour” getting acquainted with our daughter. DH and I both cried and it was such a great moment. I apparently sustained 2 labial tears &amp; a 2nd degree urethral tear. Beeb got a bath and a visit from the pediatrician, and everything went very well.  I had a quick shower (which was painful and awkward, but getting fresh clothing on was glorious) and moved to a recovery room. While beeb was able to latch briefly during our golden hour, it was just not happening by the time our second feeding was supposed to happen. I was getting increasingly frustrated because she started purple crying, as my parents stood by awkwardly watching me trying to breastfeed from across the room. My parents were too excited to see/hold her that her rooting behaviors were initially ignored, and she became too frustrated to latch. DH returned after feeding our animals and I begged him to get the nurse so we could feed with formula. He sat with her and fed her, and within seconds she was contently milkdrunk. We had Em spend her first night in the nursery since we had been awake for close to 24 exhausting hours at that point. I got 5 whole hours of uninterrupted sleep, which hadn’t happened since my 2nd trimester. It was glorious.  We met with a lactation consultant right before we left, and she did note that beeb has a little bit of a “lazy suck” and gets frustrated when latched if she doesn’t get milk instantly from a nipple. For this reason, and so DH can feed/bond with LO, I’ve been exclusively pumping since. We were discharged 2 days later on Wednesday and have been doing well. LO is a squeaky little love bug!

s,"TLDR: Period late by 4 days, possible delay due to antibiotic use/stress, poor timing and too anxious to take a pregnancy test..I know this is dumb but i could really use some advice and have no one to ask about this other than the internet:I’m a 20 year old college student. My partner and I rely on withdrawal (im aware that this is irresponsible, but its already in the past- please don’t try to lecture me) and i am not taking any other form of birth control. Despite the general ineffectiveness of pulling out, i am confident that no semen has entered my vagina as he ALWAYS finished visibly and entirely outside and cleans his penis afterwards to account for precum/sperm mixing.I use a period tracker app which is fairly accurate in predicting my period, but i tend to start 1-3 days later than the projected time, my average cycle is about 28 days. According to the app, I am 4 days late, making my cycle 31 days at this point. I have never been this late before and have had all of my usual PMS symptoms (sore breasts, increased appetite, mild cramping) but no matter how much I wish I would, my period won’t start. I had a UTI during the third week of my cycle and was prescribed nitrofurantoin macro twice a day for 5 days, i accidentally missed 2 doses so i ended up taking it for a total of six days. I’ve read that antibiotics can inhibit ovulation/mess with your cycle so I guess i’m wondering if anyone has had experience with this or if this is even characteristic of the antibiotic i was prescribed.I am obviously worried that i am pregnant, but I’ve also read that stress can delay your period and as i took my university finals last week i have obviously been under a lot of stress/slept inconsistently and now my delayed period has given me added anxiety. Besides the symptoms that could be attributed to PMS, i haven’t experienced any change/darkening in my nipples, my urination is normal, and i haven’t noticed any back pain. I am also a highly anxious person and a hypochondriac so I’m not sure if I’m actually more fatigued/nauseous/moody than normal or if I’m reading too much into my anxiety. Lastly, I know i could just take a pregnancy test but I’ve read that you should wait a week after your missed period in order to get accurate results. Additionally, I am staying with relatives for the next 10 days who cannot know that i am pregnant (if i am). Because of this, even on the chance that i take a test and it turns out positive I wouldn’t be able to do anything about it until after I return home (SoCal) and i would only be more anxious during this time. Maybe i just needed to vent but if anyone at all has had a similar experience or has some comforting advice that would be great thanks.",0.0,0.572824,0.791039,0.674539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22954091816367264
s,"Hi everyone. I just found this website a week ago and I have been spending a lot of time reading up on threads and such to get familiar. I think this is the place to be asking questions and getting advice for these sorts of things, but if not, could someone please point me in the right direction?I'm a 21 year old college student, and I feel like the universe is kind of conspiring against me. I've always had fears of intimacy because my parents are very ""wait until marriage"" centered, so I'm still a virgin, seeing as I live with them and I want to respect their rules. However, my boyfriend (22) and I have been taking very small steps to get away from that mindset, and I've finally managed to see sex and intimacy as something that isn't ""wrong"" or ""sinful"". My boyfriend and I have been together for six years and we are very serious about the idea of marriage when I graduate, so we thought that we were ready to take our relationship to the next level.On December 4th, 2016 I felt comfortable enough to engage in oral sex (me to him). I enjoyed it, which I didn't expect, but I'm terrified that I somehow got pregnant from it. It's very irrational, I know, but I can't get the thought out of my head.I know it's incredibly unlikely that I am pregnant. I didn't allow him to touch me, not even with his hands and especially not with his mouth (I'm still much too shy and guarded when it comes to receiving pleasure instead of giving it). I'm scared that when I went to the restroom about 40 minutes afterward that I accidentally got semen from my hands or mouth inside me and impregnanted myself. When I went to the bathroom I discovered that I had started my period as well, so I thought maybe while I was wiping/ putting on the panty liner some managed to wiggle it's way in me. At the time I wasn't on birth control (parents refused to even talk about it), but I have since started it on January 31st. I thought my fears would go away once my next period rolled around, but it only brought more fear. Leading up to my period, I began experiencing ""symptoms"" of pregnancy. My lower back hurt a lot, I had headaches (something I had never had before this), but the worse thing was this pressure in my bladder/uterus area as well as this feeling of a ""bubble"" pressing down on my left ovary. The pressure in my bladder/uterus began on December 23, and continued until I couldn't stand it anymore and went to a hospital on December 28th. At the hospital I was so scared that they were going to tell me I was pregnant. They gave me a urine test, which came out as negative, and I also got a CT scan to see if I was having any internal damage. The CT scan found that I had a cyst the size of a large raisin that burst on my right ovary recently. Lab tests showed that I had a kidney infection/UTI, which explained the pain in my back and bladder. I was given a prescription for Macrobid and sent home.I was okay until January 2nd rolled around and I didn't get my period. This terrified me. Before this, I have only had one late period my entire life. My ""period"" shows up on January 6th (4 days late), but it's unlike any I've ever had before. It's mostly brown blood and it's so light I almost don't notice it. I typically have moderate to heavy periods, so this was a huge flag to me. As the day wore on the bleeding turned more red and I began seeing some of the ""chunks"" I'm used to, but I'm still not bleeding as much as usual. However, I'm mostly convinced my period has come and I'm safe. When I go to change my liner, however, I notice this chunk of flesh thing. It scares me because I assume I'm having a miscarriage or something. As the day wears on I get more and more of these fleshy things, some short and flat, others long and stringy. I break down and start crying because this has never happened to me before. I call my mother into the bathroom to show her and she laughs at me and tells me what I'm experiencing is normal, especially after a ruptured cyst. My mother was a nurse for 12 years, so I do believe her, but I'm not entirely convinced. My ""period"" continues very lightly until the 8th (unusual for me, because I typically menstruate for 4 days), stops on the 9th, and begins around noon on the 10th with very dark, small spotting that lasts about six hours. Almost as soon as my period ends, my UTI flares up again. I go to the doctor and get a prescription for Cipro, and it clears out the bacteria and I'm okay again. Two days later I begin feeling the signs of another, I go back to the doctor, but this time my test comes up negative. He says he will send my urine off to be cultured to see if there is anything unusual in it. At this point I have a mental breakdown. This pressure won't go away in my bladder, but now I'm convinced it's my uterus. The ""bubble"" on my left ovary is still present. I can't sleep, I cry constantly, I can't focus on college or even my hobbies, all I do is stay on the couch and torture myself with fears of being pregnant. My fears cause me to see symptoms in everything. My back pain is omnipresent, along with my bladder/uterus and ovary pain. I'm dizzy, I have headaches, and my breasts are sore. I begin obsessively checking my breasts for signs of darkening or growing nipples, as well as if they're growing or feel sore. I don't notice any physical changes as far as size/color/vein popping goes, but the breast pain is definitely there. I begin ""tracking"" my ovulation based on my discharge, but since I've never done it before I find it very hard to trust myself. Due to the ruptured cyst, my mother makes an appointment with the Gyno. At 21 I had never been before, but I was scared and I just needed reassurance. I was so sure that he'd find why this ""bubble"" on my left ovary never went away, and I could get medicine and be okay. He does the exam and tells me that my ovaries and breasts are completely normal, and he sends off my samples for a Papsmear. He asks me to meet him in his office and I'm so relieved, because I can finally get answers to my questions. When I get to the office my mother is there. Instead of letting me talk to the Gyno, she does most of the talking and makes me feel like a little kid. The Gyno prescribes Apri birth control for me, with instructions to begin it on the first day of my next period. He tries to leave, but I buck up the courage to ask to speak to him privately. My mother leaves the room and I ask him if the situation with my boyfriend could have led to pregnancy. He basically tells me that it's silly to think anything like that could lead to a baby, and that my fear/symptoms are all in my head. I'm not convinced but there's nothing else he can do for me. He sends me home, and I begin taking pregnancy tests.My boyfriend has bought me so many pregnancy tests, I bet he's lost at least $30. I took the tests on the following dates: December 28th, January 8th, January 15th, January 21st, January 28th, February 3rd, and February 5th. Since then he has bought me three more tests that I have yet to take. All the above tests came out negative, and they were a mixture of First Response, Clearblue, and Clearblue Digital, as well as those simple ""dip"" tests that doctors/hospitals do. Each time I see ""negative"" I feel much better, but in a day or two my ""pregnancy symptoms"" return and I begin worrying again. I've lost six pounds from stress, because I simply don't have an appetite anymore. Once I took a bite from a fried egg and it tasted like rat poison. Since then I have forced myself to eat fried eggs, just to be sure that I'm not missing any ""symptoms"". No food has bothered me since then.However, when I got my ""period"" again, it was even worse than the last one. It started January 31st, which is almost a whole week early, and it was brown as well as light. I had very, very few ""chunks"" and those I did have were small. I again had the ""flesh"" (which I've since Googled and learned were chunks of my uterine lining that didn't dissolve), and I bled for only 2 1/2 days. I began my birth control and I have been taking it every night at exactly 9:00, and so far I don't seem to be having any side effects.However, for almost three months I've been plagued by this feeling of a ""bubble"" on my left ovary. Some days it's so bad I can't wear a belt, and I spend all the time I can in my pajamas. The pressure on my bladder/uterus is always there, and I'm terrified that that means that I'm pregnant. Sometimes it feels like my bladder/ uterus is a piece of taffy that is being stretched until it snaps back into place. I've never experienced this sensation before I was intimate with my boyfriend, and when I went to my Urologist she couldn't explain it, and she has me booked for further testing on March 1st. I'm at a loss as to what to do.2X, I've never been so scared in my life. I know it's incredibly unlikely that I am pregnant, but I feel like all the signs are there that I am. I've gotten so many negative pregnancy tests and I continue to get them, but it doesn't comfort me when it constantly feels like a baby is laying on my bladder while squeezing my ovary in its fist. If I was pregnant I'd be 9 weeks. Are these symptoms of a nine week pregnancy? Am I overthinking this? All this has done is contributed to my fear of intimacy. My boyfriend is scared to touch me because of how I've reacted to all this, and I'm afraid I'll never be ""ready"" for actual sex after this. I want so badly to tell my parents about my worries, so that I can see a Gyno and get a bloodtest or ultrasound and know for sure, but if they knew that I was being intimate with my boyfriend, they would never allow me to see him again, and I'd be the family mockery. Sex is worse than drugs to them, it seems. I'm terrified of disappointing them, but I'm even more scared of being pregnant. I don't know what to do anymoreCan any one give me advice or alleviate my fears? Any tips on how to tell my parents? Or am I worried about nothing at all? Has anyone experienced any ovary/uterus/bladder pain that's similar? I'm lost and I have no one with sexual experience to turn to. ",0.0,0.578021,0.637344,0.567192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12935064935064935

s,"Two weeks post op microdiscectomy and I’m starting to get a bit of sciatica down my left leg (the leg that hurt pre-op). However, two days ago I overdid it on a walk because I was feeling so good and had really bad, stabbing low back pain on the right side (good side) upon returning home almost immediately, which slowly moved into my right glute over the next day.  Has anyone else had sciatica move to their good side post op, or might this be a pulled glute muscle and inflammation from walking for too long? I’m terrified I reherniated on the other side. Reading previous threads about reherniations, they say “you know” if you reherniated…. I don’t think “I know”, but this did feel an awful lot like sciatica in my glute.I also have a couple other things that might be contributing to the flareups I’ve been feeling on my usual side:I’m finding my legs are starting to get really restless while lying down. All I want to do is stretch them and do some nerve flossing! My neurosurgeon said not to do any of that til 8 weeks, but sometimes I do point / flex my feet in bed to take some of the tension off.I have also needed to put some foot cream on (necessary for incredibly itchy athletes foot!) while in a seated position with my foot propped up on my opposite knee (like a figure 4). This is on my right (good side) though. I keep my back really straight but I’m wondering if doing this can put added stress on my disc and nerve?Lastly, I’ve gotten a U- shaped pregnancy pillow to keep me from twisting while in my sleep. Works great! But I have found I need to reposition while in bed to get in the right spot. I end up having to do this a few times in the night. It ends up being a mini glute bridge to scoot my bum into the right spot. Feels fine but I’m not sure how it is if I do it several times per day / night while in bed.Any ideas on any of those, contributing to a reherniation or flare-up of my nerves?

Also looking for advice if the light flossing / foot cream figure 4 / mini glute bridge to reposition my bum in bed are big no-no’s for post op.Thanks so much!

s,"So I posted about floating a few weeks ago, and got a lot of down vote hate, but I just went back for my second float, and I think more people need to know about this.

I work an incredibly stressful high profile corporate job and my head is constantly filled with decisions, questions, and who knows what else.

c,"Hey there, I've been working on my awful posture for a few years now, and I'm finally where I want to be.  Here are a couple resources that I've used.   But please be careful, OP; what you need is specific to you, so don't just do something that someone tells you.  There are different types of 'bad posture,' so make sure you understand what yours is and what you need to do before jumping into a routine (especially from a Redditor who hasn't even seen you!!!). Firstly, here's a great excel file put together by another redditor.  It shows the common posture problems and which exercise to use to correct them. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EgKFYKjUIzpc_ZG_uRg1pKM3D64UFZ14299K7ppatHU/htmlview?pli=1 Next, here's two full write ups about the anterior-pelvic-tilt and ""computer guy posture"", which are common posture problems.  You should also look through the OP's history to find his write-ups on other problems that may be more relevant to you.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ewrr0/writeup_on_the_dreaded_anterior_pelvic_tilt_or/ https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/exgiu/a_guide_to_fixing_computer_guy_posture_upper_body/ Others have also posted this video, and I did this exercise consistently for a year.  It helped my lower back pain, but again, it's one video from a huge collection by Eric Goodman.  You should browse his other videos and find what works for you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BOTvaRaDjI Lastly, weight training can help improve posture if you do it with proper form. [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.com/) is a great book that has developed into a community for beginner weight lifting.  Somewhere you have weak muscles that contribute to your bad posture, and a general weight lifting routine will help strengthen everything and help you maintain the benefits from the targeted routines and stretches.

s,"As a kid, my parents would only encourage me in my academics and nothing else was important to them. My mom is also mentally unstable and unable to recognize that or admit it, so my parents would frequently fight. Starting at 10, I would play peacemaker. I would try to calm my mom down while my dad collected his thoughts and eventually apologized (even though it was almost never his fault). So there wasn’t enough stability to have my own emotions at home and I moved schools often and changed churches even more so there wasn’t anybody I was friends with for more than 2 years. I didn’t think anybody had the time for me because everybody has their own problems. So I just turned 19 2 days ago and I’m at a very academically intense university. I’d taken CCP classes for years and thought that I was prepared, but I’m not doing well in my classes. I feel like I’m not worth anything if I can’t even do school. I want to get up to my Ph.D and my dream job is to be on the edge of research for AI. My parents are very manipulative and every time I come home my mental state degrades. I’ve been with this really amazing guy for 10 months now that my parents don’t like and we’ve had some issues recently. We both struggle with depression and for a long time I’ve been trying to help him with his depression and dissatisfactory state of life, but in the process i disregarded my own mental health and that’s my own damn fault. Last night I went over to his place to break up with him, but I got there and started talking and my anxiety spiked so high that I couldn’t get any words out. I was trying to explain why I didn’t think I was good for him. That I just cause him pain. That I can’t give him what he needs and that it’s all my fault.  He was mad at first, but then noticed how much I was blaming myself. He wanted to know if there was something he’d done or something about him that was wrong. My only excuses were that he might not go to college and academics are super important to me, but even without college he’s very intelligent. He has motivation issues that I try so hard to help with that I often feel like I need the motivation for two people. But he’s been so good recently. I haven’t had to do much. I had talked with my parents about it earlier that day and they kept saying things like I could do better and that I didn’t need to settle. I thought maybe they were right, but after the conversation I had with my boyfriend, I feel like I was just being blinded by my parents constant stream of negativity. The only thing that’s a legitimate reason is that I become depressed when he is depressed and even though he’s the person I trust and care for the most, I can’t even bring myself to be honest with my emotions to him. Instead of breaking up he asked if we could go on a break and grow as our own people because he doesn’t want to lose me. I don’t want to lose him either. I don’t know what I’m doing or what I need and I feel like I’m just a burden to everyone and that I can’t even be successful by the one thing that I’ve valued myself in for so long which is my academics. I don’t know how to move forward. I want to heal my mind and love myself as much as I love my boyfriend. I’m also a Christian and so a goal that I also want to achieve is to strengthen my relationship with Christ and truly make Him the center of my life, because I’m realizing that I can’t do this on my own. Even with counseling I feel like there’s no improvement and I just hate myself and I want to die. If I can’t even be smart enough to do something good for the world, why should I even live. I just want to be good for people. But I suck at that. Look at this pity party.  I want to care for others but this looks like I’m just caring for myself. I feel so selfish and stupid. I don’t want to keep doing this.I’ve been going to counseling. I’ve been trying to eat healthy. I’ve been trying to make sure I’m social and with people. I’m trying to manage my responsibilities and scale down where I know I can’t handle any more. I’ve spoken to professors (the university I go to is very good and student teacher interaction. 4th in the nation) about the fact that I want to cut myself and kill myself.

By the 7th month I couldn't sleep from constant pain and I couldn't walk very well either, it was a struggle just getting out of a chair or walking to the bathroom. I also had bad carpal tunnel syndrome and I thought my hands would never be normal again! The week before LO's birth, I had stayed up over 72 hours straight because I literally couldn't sleep. And when I finally did it was only for 45 minutes at a time. It turns out I had preeclamsia which may be why I was feeling like crap all the time and couldn't walk/move around though. Anyway, I was induced at 35 weeks and if I could go back and do it over again I'd schedule a c section in a heartbeat. My epidural didn't work and after two days of agonizing labor and three hours of pushing with extreme back pain and little progress, I begged for a c section and that's what it ended with. Every delivery is different, but I should have just had a c section to begin with. My body was just too weak to push properly and I was too stubborn to realize that. I feel so guilty for putting my LO through that, they also tried vacuuming her out as a last ditch effort and her poor head was so disfigured for awhile. I recovered quickly from the c section and was already back to work after 3 weeks so it wasn't nearly as bad as I imagined. I felt a million times better than when I was pregnant at least!

s,"So, a bit of background information.I am 29, female, weigh 69 kilos, and have been experiencing severe abdominal pain, that came on suddenly, for 3 years now. I don't have an appendix. Multiple tests have been done including a laparoscopy that showed adhesions and a tiny amount of endometriosis (despite a year and a half on depo provera), but this has not resolved the pain. Almost every test comes back negative from gastroenterologists, to gynecologists, endocrinologist and a pain specialist. I've had a colonoscopy, multiple ultrasounds, more blood tests than I can count, and even nerve blocks in my spine (that did not work). In the last year I've had some other bizarre complaints that don't seem related. I've had pain shooting down my right (dominant) leg that I assumed my be sciatica. There was only concern when I began to experience weakness in my legs (more pronounced in the right) and sometimes my legs give way completely and cannot support my weight. This typically improves with rest. It's scary for myself and my partner but not quite as debilitating as the abdominal pain. I also get tingling and numbness in my right leg that improves when my gabapentin dose is increased. I also have occasional urinary retention and a sense of urgency to go when my bladder is empty.Finally, after 3 years, a specialist ordered a pelvic MRI on my request. Without looking specifically for it, the MRI showed something called dural ectasia in my spine. Now, the problem is that no doctor, including the specialists, can tell me what this means. One of my doctor's did google it and just told me it's to do with the connective tissue surrounding the cerebrospinal fluid. I do not understand what this means for me. I don't know if it's connected to my abdominal pain, or my odd leg issues, or the bladder problems. I don't know what has caused this or, if it is connected to my issues, if this is something that will improve, degenerate or remain stable. I am lost and feel utterly helpless at this stage. It is not easy to be in so much pain and have no answers. I am desperate for any light that could be shed on this, even if it's just a reassure me that it means nothing.",0.0,0.670126,0.839808,0.622451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23316062176165803
c,"&gt; Sensible resistance training involves precise controlled movements for each major muscle group and does not require the use of very heavy resistance. Along with brief prescriptive steady-state aerobic exercise, resistance training should be a central component of public health promotion programs. * http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11676593 &gt;Resistance training may be effective for reducing low back pain and easing discomfort associated with arthritis and fibromyalgia and has been shown to reverse specific aging factors in skeletal muscle. * http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22777332 &gt;Resistance training is recommended by national health organizations for incorporation into a comprehensive fitness program that includes aerobic and flexibility exercise. Its potential benefits on health and performance are numerous; it has been shown to reduce body fat, increase basal metabolic rate, decrease blood pressure and the cardiovascular demands to exercise, improve blood lipid profiles, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity, increase muscle and connective tissue cross-sectional area, improve functional capacity, and relieve low back pain. Many improvements in physical function and athletic performance are associated with the increases in muscle strength, power, endurance, and hypertrophy observed during resistance training. The key element to effective resistance training is supervision by a qualified professional and the proper prescription of the program variables. Proper program design, ie, that which uses progressive overload, variation, and specificity, is essential to maximize the benefits associated with resistance training. * http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12831709 &gt; In conclusion, it was found that a periodized resistance training intervention performed within the workplace improved different aspects of health and fitness in untrained men, thereby potentially providing other work-related benefits.

c,"&gt;I'm not alone. Endo affects some 10% of women, but it takes the average woman over eight doctors to get a diagnosis. Women are more likely to be referred to a therapist for endo than to any relevant medical treatment. It's also because it's nearly impossible to correctly diagnose.  Ultrasound and CT (most common imaging studies) don't have the sensitivity to pick it up.  MRI may, but that's hard to obtain and pre-cert.  Gold standard for diagnosis is actually surgery, so the threshold is high there. It's shockingly less about women being women and more about lack of efficient testing modality, or understanding of how poor they are.  You can't willy-nilly laparoscopically operate on people, especially if that's not in your realm.

c,"I’ve had some really terrible period pain in my life. Like, knock down drag out can’t function period pain. For me, labor pain was different.  However, I will say that my kid was sunny side up, which caused both labor that caused cervical change and back labor to start about 3.5 weeks before the tiny human made her entrance into the world.  I was tired. I was hurting. I asked for the epidural when I was at 3.5 centimeters because my back was killing me after a couple of weeks of faking me out with labor that would start and stop that wrapped around to my back. And then the epidural didn’t work and stalled my labor (which I figured out after they’d hooked me up to Pitocin and the contractions came back with a walloping force) and the anesthesiologist was in an emergency C and didn’t come back to see me until I’d hit 9.5 centimeters and they were calling my doc to tell him to get to the hospital because I was basically ready to push. It was bearable for me until somewhere in the middle between 3.5 and 9.5. (That transition was like 3-4 hours though. Pitocin REALLY worked for me.) Halfway between the 3.5 and 9.5, I was shouting at the nurse to go find the anesthesiologist because it hurt so bad. Back labor sucks. When they told me that back labor sucked, I didn’t know how much they were talking about. The nurse felt so bad for me that she went to the OR to see when they’d be done and drag him back to my room ASAP. Ha. My best friend, the anesthesiologist, came in and LOADED me up so that I could at least push without the crazy back pain. They switched the meds and then gave me an extra injection of something... I don’t know what exactly, but it worked and I was able to focus on evicting my beautiful spawn from her nice warm home instead of not being able to focus on anything other than the intense labor and back pain. I don’t say all of this to scare you. I say this because I was on the fence about wanting an epidural before the last month of pregnancy, although I wasn’t against it. If my kid had been in the right position and wasn’t born stargazing, it might have been different. My choice to get an epidural and then to holler down the house so the anesthesiologist came back and fixed it were last minute calls for me.  To be fair, I handled several weeks of mildly annoying to pain that would momentarily hit a 7 on the pain scale for me and by the time I was ready to get my kid out of me, I was done. But it was in those last moments I made the decision.  Also, getting the epidural placed wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be... My plan was to go with the flow and make a decision based on how I was feeling in the moment.

I was over the moon. We've played this out in real life (my birthday night included) but it was great that I get to listen to it from time to time when I drive to work. We I usually listen to music but yesterday morning, I decided to listen to one of her newer recordings. When I visited her channel, I saw she uploaded the personalized recording she made me. I felt violated cause it was supposed to be personal and it was one of the things I've only told her. She didn't add any identifying details to the recording (which I should've taken as a hint that she would post this) but it's still embarrassing having something so personal out in public. When I got home (we live together), I confronted her about it and told her how upsetting it was to have something that I thought was personal out in public. She didn't seem to understand why I was so upset so we ended up fighting. She said that if it would make me happy, she would take it down but that it was one of her more popular recordings so her followers might get upset. She doesn't seem to see why I'd be so upset by it. It wasn't resolved so I ended up sleeping on the couch cause I was too hurt to sleep next to her (I couldn't ask her to leave the bedroom. She has a very bad back so if she sleeps anywhere else, it will most likely cause her extreme back pain. I still love her). I told her I'd post on Reddit and see what internet strangers think (cause we don't talk about our relationship problems to friends) and she agreed. So here I am. Do I have the right to feel violated? Is she right that this shouldn't be a big deal? What should I/we do going forward? Any insight and advice would be welcome. Also, please don't comment the usual ""break up"" line. Neither of us want to break up and we both believe we can work through this. We both still love each other.

Here’s the rub, that person isn’t a physician but a nurse practitioner and isn’t being supervised by a physician. “Dr.” Karen NP got her nurse practitioner degree online and her clinical hours were basically a fraction of what even a medical student does while the quality of her hours are the equivalent of what a premed does when shadowing a physician. “Dr” Karen misdiagnoses your loved one because they don’t know what they don’t know.

s,"Hello. I'll keep it as short as possible. I graduated high school in 2015 (just barely) by spending long hours at a desk grinding out my credit recovery programs. Poor health habits left me with an EXTREMELY severe case of sciatica, and I was unable to even get out of bed for nearly a year. Fast forward to 2016, physical therapy and general caring more about myself left me able to apply for my first job! A seasonal warehouse associate position at Amazon. Silly me, I had no idea that the hours I applied for had little to nothing to do with the hours I was really going to work. I learned rather quickly just how badly my body takes a job like this. Even 6 hours on my feet (I have remained between 325-350 lbs for the last ten years) leave me in excruciating pain in my feet and along my sciatic nerve, it was literally hell. I tried my hardest to make rate, to be on time from breaks, but around a month into it, I suffered an ankle injury off site, at home. Needless to say, doctors note or not, the work didn't get easier, and I had to quit. My next job, at American bolt &amp; screw, was at a warehouse through an agency but work of a different kind entirely. I would sit there and sort thousands of small parts, good ones in one box and bad one in another. While this job was monotonous and boring as all hell, it was work I could actually do, and I was pretty damn happy with it. Unfortunately after about 6 months my contract ended and they didn't end up keeping me. From that point in 2017, it was a dry spell. No one would call me back, not grocery stores, not Amazon, not offices, no one. I live in Southern California and it seems getting non warehouse work out here is nearly impossible for a resume like mine. Which brings us to present day, I started my latest job here at FedEx around 3 weeks ago. It's easily a hundred times better than Amazon, I got hired on through knowing someone (this is the only time I've ever gotten a call back). Unfortunately, the core issue remains. My feet hurt. They hurt so bad, that I don't think about anything else at work. A 12 hour workday ends with me crying myself to sleep. I get massages, I spent 100+$ on work shoes, I spent 70+$ on special medical insoles for overweight people. While all making a difference, it's still so unbearable that I find myself having tears in my eyes while on the job. My personal history with physical pain is a long one, I even once almost took my own life because I was in so much pain at a time. Nowadays, my tolerance for this kind of stuff is at an all time low. My mental stability is slowly waning as the pain only gets worse and worse. I know, it'll get better, trust me I hear it all the time. But I'm not anyone else, I'm me, and I'm my honest opinion, my physical condition is only getting worse because of this. On top of all of this, I have a wonderful girlfriend and soon to be step daughter who need me to at LEAST be able to get the 700$ a month rent starting in January. I don't know what to do. I wanna die before work and after work everyday, this pain is too much for me to be happy even when I receive a paycheck. I have expirience with computers, in fact I'm really good with them. I have expirience managing a social media page and an audience, but that's the kinda stuff that only matters with a degree. I have a passion for pharmacy tech but school just doesn't seem like an option with these many responsibilities piling up. I don't care if I make a dollar less an hour, all I want is a job where I can sit and work, I don't care if it's 14 hours a day, I'll do it gladly. Please, if anyone has any advice I'll take it. An office job, a calm center, anything like that is what I'm looking for. What should I do?Thank you for your time.

s,"i have used pot twice in the last month, and after both times, my back has been so incrediably stiff and painful its extremely difficult to move. background- i have had pretty regular, mostly moderate but sometimes severe, back pain for the last 7 years, ever since i was pregnant with my son. i admit, i'm overweight by quite a bit, and this probably affects my pain, as i have a small physical stature and the extra weight adds unnecessary pressure. i usually just take over the counter ibuprofen, and my dosage has increased over the years to about 1000 mg a pop (usually can get away with just one such dosage/day). It is worse when i work (fast food manager, 8 hrs on my feet, constantly moving).Anyway, back to the pot. i've been wanting to try it because i've heard it can mellow you out, and i've been suffering from depression for the last several years, as well as some stress the last few weeks. a friend of mine offered to share a bowl with me, and it was the good, medical grade stuff. for the 2 days after, i could barely move. my back hurt so bad my ibu didn't touch it. heating pads, hot showers, stretching, massage, nothing worked out the kinks. didn't really correlate this to the pot usuage, until yesterday. smoked with my husband after a date on friday, and the last couple days, especially yesterday, my back pain level was on about a 12-15 out of a scale of 10 (usually about a 7). Now, as i have extremely little experience with weed, and my husband is former pothead, he says that the drug is a muscle relaxor and this is why my pain was so bad after getting high, and that he would prefer it if i don't use it anymore to prevent such high levels of pain and discomfort. i've heard that pot can be used to help with chronic pain, but if what he says is true, why was my pain so bad? does this mean it should be a daily habit if its used as a pain control? Because if that's true, i don't want to use it. I do not have a medical card for it, do not want to get one, and quite honestly, only wanted to have a bit of fun on weed.

s,"It wasn’t the best or easiest pregnancy. I was sick with HG from week 6, but got a few good weeks between 18-25 (got married and went on our honeymoon!) before I started to feel worse and worse. I remember my midwife telling me around 25 that I should enjoy this time because I was about to get really uncomfortable and she was right!As I got bigger I started to feel worse and worse. The HG came back and by week 33 I was really struggling with low back pain, pelvic pain, abdominal pain, constantly feeling like I needed to pee, insomnia and, shockingly, irritability. My midwife was a bit concerned at my 36 week appointment because my BP was elevated and I had developed some edema in my ankles and hands (goodbye, wedding rings!) but a NST showed that baby was still doing fine. Midwife said that I’d likely go in for another NST after my 37 week apt to keep an eye on things and I pressured her into giving me an induction date – October 20, 10 days after my EDD. I was so relieved to know the date I could press the eject button because by this point I was quite miserable. I was scheduled to work until Sept 30 but was exhausted and cranky and uncomfortable all day every day.On Sunday the 18th my husband and I did some last minute errands at the mall. I was not very happy that day. I could barely walk due to the pain in my hips, pelvis and low back, and was irrationally mad at my husband for normal things such as needing to walk to get to the washroom at the mall. In hindsight, I was in early labour. When we got home I burst into tears, “I just don’t want to be pregnant anymore,” I wailed. I was feeling sorry for myself and ran a bath to relax. When I got out of the bath I noticed that I was experiencing some period cramps and kept feeling the need to have a BM. I tried going to the washroom several times but only ended up wiping away what I realized was my mucous plug. It was like egg white discharge that had a bit of colour at times, other times it was completely clear. Around 5pm I told my husband that I thought I might be having some contractions, but because I was 36+6 this might not mean anything at all so I’d just keep an eye on things. I had put on a pad due to the mucous plug, and was lying in bed around 10 when I felt a small gush. I sat up and ran to the washroom where more liquid came out of me and was pretty convinced that it was my water breaking. I called the midwife who recommended I take a gravol and Tylenol and try to get some sleep, but to call her if the contractions came 5 minutes apart for 3 hours. I laid in bed until about midnight and tried to sleep (LOL, who can sleep when they might be in labour?!) but by midnight I was having very painful contractions that were coming frequently. I told my husband that I was going to start timing them but to be prepared as I thought I was in labour.A note about my husband: he is lovely. Very lovely, but not the most prepared person in the whole world. So it was only at this point in my pregnancy that he picked up the pregnancy book to read about early labour. Yes, midnight and my contractions were 90 seconds long, 5 minutes apart, and he was making suggestions like “the book says early labour can last a while and you should do an activity like go for a walk in the park. Do you want to go for a walk?” Luckily for him I wasn’t able to talk through the contractions so he didn’t know what I thought about his “helpful suggestions” and I sent him to bed so I wouldn’t have to listen to any more of his nonsense. I labored while he slept for the next 2 hours but by 2am the contractions were almost unbearable and I was weeping in between them. I always thought I’d try to have a drug free birth, but I certainly was not married to the idea and was open to any interventions that would result in a successful delivery. By this point I knew I would not be able to make it without an epidural so I woke up my husband to let him know it was go time (“do you want to go for a walk first? The book says maybe you should have a bath?”) and at 3am called the midwife to meet us at the hospital.I threw a couple changes of clothes into my bag in the 3 minutes I had between contractions, and we started to load up the car. My husband, lovely as he is, still did not realize the extent of pain I was in and, mid contraction, would ask me vital questions such as “have you seen the umbrella?” I finally lost my cool entirely on him and screamed “STOP ASKING ME QUESTIONS WHEN I’M IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONTRACTION I DON’T CARE ABOUT THE FUCKING UMBRELLA.”  I think it was at that point he realized that I was not fucking around.We got to the hospital at 4am and I asked for an epidural right away since I knew it could take a while. The midwife got things rolling and had a nurse come in to place the IV saline to prep me, but because my veins are so small she was having some issues getting a vein. She finally found one and tried to place the IV but my vein collapsed almost immediately and she ran out of the room. Later I found out that she had pricked herself with the needle and ran to get another nurse, but left my tourniquet around my arm in her understandable haste. Did you know that leaving the tourniquet on would turn your vein into Old Faithful? However, I didn’t even notice that I was spewing blood since the contractions were so painful. After that, 2 more nurses came in to place the IV but they both also failed. Finally, at 7am the anesthesiologist came in and placed the IV in my hand, and gave me the epidural. I was able, at last, to get some relief. The epidural was amaaaaazing but gave me the shakes really badly. I have never experienced anything like that before but luckily they went away after an hour or so.Once I was comfortable, Rob went out to meet his parents for breakfast. The midwife had said it would be several more hours until anything would be happening, so I felt okay with him going out for half an hour or so. Once he left, the pain started increasing so I asked the nurse if we could top up the epidural. She pressed the button and almost immediately the baby’s heart rate started dropping. Normal heart rate is around 140 BPM but I heard it slow and slow to about 75-80 BPM. The nurse seemed very concerned and I asked if I should text Rob to get him to come back – it had only been about 10 minutes. She nodded and while I texted him to come back ASAP, the room filled with people. My position was adjusted a few times before his heart rate stabilized, but after that I had to stay lying on my side to prevent any more decels. Once everything was settled Rob came running back in the room thinking I was delivering but by that point all the excitement had died down. Until noon I dozed and chatted with Rob, the midwife and the nurse. They had told me that I would probably push for 2 hours and at about 12:15 the midwife checked me again and told me I was fully dilated and ready to push. At this point I started to get some anxiety; I knew that the last 9 months had been leading up to this moment but somehow I didn’t feel like I had enough notice. I had a mad desire to tell everyone I wasn’t ready, but I was ready…at least my body was. I started to get pressure with each contraction like I was going to have a BM. Because we were too nervous about another decel to top up the epidural again, I was able to feel the pressure with each contraction and the midwife coached me on how to push with the contractions. Rob held my hand and the intern held my leg as I pushed. With each contraction I would take a deep breath and push down, then quickly take another deep breath and push into that one so the progress wasn’t lost. I was getting about 4-5 pushes with each contraction but it didn’t feel like I was making much headway. I was pushing so hard it was making me nauseous, and as time went on the epidural started to wear off. Finally, the midwife told me that we were very close and that I would notice increased pressure that didn’t let up; once this would happen I was to listen to her coaching for each push so I didn’t tear. A few more pushes later and I could feel him very engaged, the pressure was incredible and it was very painful. Prior to this there was relief in between contractions, but at this point there was no relief between them at all. The midwife was telling me to push but I was scared and crying out that I couldn’t do it; if I was able I would have walked right out of there. I truly felt that I wasn’t able to go on but right at that moment, the nurse put her face close to mine and in my ear told me that I was so close, that I was almost there. This gave me the strength to push again, and I cried out with the gush that came out of me and my son was born! I was sobbing with relief and surprise and being completely overwhelmed and I couldn’t believe that I had done it. On Monday September 19th at 2:14pm, I had actually given birth to my son.The midwife took him and placed him on my chest and I got to see his face for the first time. He was tiny and perfect, and looked at me with dark grey eyes. I was still sobbing in disbelief that I had made this creature and that I was his mom now. I couldn’t believe that this human had been inside me just a few moments before. I looked at him and he looked back at me, and he pursed his lips into a tiny O shape, something he would keep doing to this day.The nurse and midwife pressed on my stomach a bit and tugged at the cord and asked me to push. I gave one final push and the placenta came out with a flop, and I was flooded with a sense of relief. I’m not sure why but it was almost more relieving than birthing the baby. By now the cord had stopped pulsing so Rob cut it and they took the baby to be weighed and measured – 6lbs 10.5 oz. The midwife was very impressed by his striking cone head and joked that it would probably add a few inches to his length. They looked me over and said I had a couple abrasions but no tears so they got me set up with the mesh panties and an ice pack (amazing!) and let us rest skin to skin.We spent some time in the delivery room until I was able to pee, then we moved into the maternity ward around 5pm. The nurse kindly brought me some tea and toast, and some dinner a bit later. I felt like I had run a marathon. We tried breastfeeding but it was very difficult for him to latch, I wasn’t making any colostrum, and he was also very, very sleepy and didn’t have any interest in feeding. The next day the midwife recommended I stay another night in the hospital until we were confident with breastfeeding and she gave me a nipple shield to try. This helped a tiny bit, but we still really struggled; my nipples were bleeding and painful and I started to dread feeding him.The next day as we were packing up all of our belongings to go home, a nurse came in and told us that baby was very jaundiced and would have to be admitted to the NICU for phototherapy. She recommended supplementing with formula and starting to pump, and as soon as I agreed they had whisked him off. The combination of hormones, and finding out that my son was not okay and perfect made me break down. With tears streaming down my face, I listened to the pediatrician tell me that I would need to stay several more days in the hospital. We were put on a new schedule – every 3 hours I would go to the NICU to breastfeed for 15 minutes, then the nurse would feed him formula under the lights and I would pump for 15 minutes. The formula was necessary to flush the bilirubin from his system as my milk hadn’t yet come in. The pediatrician explained that we had an ABO blood type incompatibility that caused the jaundice, and it would take a few extra days to get his levels under control. After 3 days of being under quadruple lights, he was finally well enough to come home. It’s been 2 and a half weeks since then, and it still feels a bit surreal. I have this tiny creature that is so helpless and tiny, but who loves to snuggle and nap with me. We’re still having some issues breastfeeding, but he’s eating and gaining weight and I can see his tiny fingers getting chubby. My pregnancy was planned but the timing was not. I was hugely surprised when we found out which made it hard for me to get excited about having a baby. I didn’t feel ready to give up my life and my relationship quite yet. Further, I was so miserable for most of the time I wasn’t able to imagine that I would or could be happy when he finally came. Now that I have him, I wish I could re-do my pregnancy. I wish that I could know that I would love this perfect nugget so much, and that I would have the best little snuggle buddy anyone could ask for. I think that if I had known how I feel now, I would have enjoyed my pregnancy a lot more…or at least not been so resentful of every pain and inconvenience it brought. People always said that the moment I laid eyes on him I would fall in love. I’m not sure if that’s true for me, exactly. The birthing process is amazing and awe inspiring and overwhelming. There were so many feelings that I’m sure love was one of them, but as the days go by the love just grows and grows. Even though I’m tired from being up all night, I’m trying to savor the moments when the house is quiet and I have a warm, tiny, perfect human on my chest. Rocking him to sleep at 3am is something that I never thought I’d be okay with but somehow I never want to let go of the moments when everything is still and our lives stretch out in front of us with so much potential. Thinking of the future brings me to tears because I know these times are so special and so precious and every night that I hold him is one that I can never get back. This sub was an integral part of my pregnancy. I didn’t post much but I gained so much strength from connecting with you ladies. I’m not sure if I can think of a more welcoming, supportive, empathetic and understanding place for somebody going through such a huge life change. Thank you all for sharing your stories and offering your strength and wisdom. You have touched me in a way that I will never forget, and I am so grateful to have been a part of this community.

c,"&gt;1 - Is it normal to have almost no idea of what note is being played? It sounds normal. You're going to improve a lot, especially since you already listen to music outside of practice. Try listening to music pieces with the sheets - it's a great practice routine and will improve your sightreading. Grab some sheets from IMSLP, I suggest something not that complex, but still pleasant. Kuhlau sonatinas, Op. 55 and Op. 20, Clementi sonatinas Op. 36, Beethoven sonatas from Op. 49 and Op. 14, the Mozart Sonata in C, K545. &gt;2 - Is it normal to have wrist pain and back pain after playing long sessions? That's definitely not normal, and suggests that you are practicing too long, practicing with improper technique, or (likely) both. Keep in mind that 30-45 minutes of playing practice per day for a beginner is perfectly fine. If you have more time, learn theory, listen to pieces, practice sightreading. Your hands need to get used to hitting the piano keys. Improving technique is hard without a teacher, but try to watch some basic videos, focus on not building up the tension - ideally, you should not feel tense at all. Keep firm, but relaxed. Here are some videos on basic technique I would recommend: - [Introductory remarks from a Suzuki method teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie-_mIhrZpo) - [Seating and posture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_70ezPjaUw) - [Hand position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_6y7MPW_Ek) - [Fingering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udGdqJh5luM) - [How to practice technical studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV6O9v5n0kg) Practice safely, and have fun doing it.",0.630711,0.600017,0.750477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.256198347107438
c,"I had an abortion for the same reason.  I 100% do not regret it.  My son's 2nd birthday is on Thursday, and I'm still depressed as shit from the complete lack of support I had, the daily sickness, the fact it's ruined my teeth, I've got a slipped disk and I still get PGP.  I didn't really even want 1 kid. A child was never in my life plan. I fell pregnant on the coil though, and the doctors decided to remove my coil and a few weeks later we lost that baby.  I was a mixed bag of emotions and I felt like I was only sad because that's what was expected of me, because I'd just lost a baby even though I never wanted it.  I started to get a lot of ""what if"" thoughts and ultimately we decided to try for my son, who is here and I love to bits.  But I lost about £15k in my wage that year because I couldn't work due to sickness, the pain from 9 week on was excruciating and honestly I thought my husband was going to be a great dad and support partner, but he wasn't even a good dad or support partner. He was really fucking shit.  Neither of us could really have foresaw that.  So when I fell pregnant again 6 months postpartum (after EBF, fuck you LAM method) I decided that it was time to end it.  I was less than 9weeks pregnant so I had the pessiary. I took 3 days off work but honestly I think the pessiary worked really well for me because I'm sure I passed it all on day 1, and then it was like a heavy period on day 2, and a light one on day 3 which lasted a few weeks afterwards. I got to do all this in my own home but they did offer to keep me in as an inpatient which also sounded rather appealing because I really wanted a break from home life.

s,"I had been working for a company that was delivering and building fitness equipments and we would do it for house customers as well as colleges and we would carry and build the entire gym. I had been doing it off and on for a few years under the table and the boss had two of his other works quit and he decided to put me on payroll finally, somewhere in the mix I had suffered what I believe is a pretty bad herniated disc, he asked me a few months before I quit why I was lifting with such good form(which I have tried to do from the start) and I mentioned that I hurt my back on one of the deliveries and it had been jacked up and he just kinda laughed it off and from that point on started sending me on commercial equipment deliveries which caused my back extreme discomfort, all of my coworkers would assist me to make moving the equipment as easy as possible so I wouldn’t have to bend down which was really nice of them but the boss continued to ignore that my back was in pain. I even went specially on a delivery with him and another kid to move a commercial treadmill from house to house and i expressed the discomfort and pain in bending over and lifting such weight but I still ended up at one point carrying the treadmill with just me and him to the trailer.. finally I had enough cause I told him it was hurting too bad hoping I could atleast get a day off to rest and he made a joke saying to go home and crack a 30 pack and sit in a lazyboy and I should be good. This continued for another week of him joking and not taking me serious everytime I told him he would laugh and start telling me what the next delivery would be and I told him I was quitting and I was serious that I was in pain with my back, I said I’d finish the week and be done, after that he made sure For the next two days wasn’t lifting much and was basically just building. He made me come over after a week or two of being off the job to come over and pick up my last check instead of just depositing in my account and sign papers that said I can’t work for another fitness equipment job and they really rushed me out of the house cause they were late to going camping. Im only twenty one and the dude is my neighbor so I was like whatever and just signed away not really sure what else I could have signed. They didn’t offer to pay for my back and didn’t give me health insurance while I worked there he randomly sent me a 1099 which screwed me over so I owe Aton of money on taxes, I have been getting by just donating plasma and door dash. I finally got health insurance again from my mom and now got an mri (still waiting for result) but all the places I’ve been like the doctors and the mri place keep asking me if it’s gonna be paid by me or the company. All the taxes and medical bills are really adding up and I don’t know what to do.. It’s been since about September since I quit cause the my back so I’ve been in pain for several several months and think it’s too late to call him. The dude is super money hungry so I feel like it would just cause a whole thing. He even tried to text me and call me to work for a day here and there and I’ve ignored him since.

s,"re post Just sharing my story. I literally just lost my virginity to a cute girl I met on a dating website. For years I've seduced women and got nude pics and been on nights out but never did the deed. I'm a very outgoing person and sometimes the main one in a group, but shy? Bit like a show or act I guess.So I was really anxious about my tool size. Nothing special at all 6 inches if that. I think that was a key factor in getting close to someone. Watching porn from a young age maybe gave false expectations of normality.Is 1am here in the UK, we met and just chatted at first, she had no clue, I'm a good looking guy so people have always assumed i'm some sort of sex lord. That's another reason i've had difficulties because people tend to judge books by their cover.So she rode me really hard, did missionary for a bit (wow, it's tiring!), then she rode me again. So she came 4 times while losing my virginity. She was shaking and all sorts.I read a few quick tips about pointing penis upwards before meeting so it did the trick. She said she'd never had it like that ever.Only problem is I didn't orgasm.I have bad back pain sometimes because of driving or sitting at work, so take tramadol if it's really bad. Think this and lots of masturbation stopped me from coming.I feel kind of numb and tips of my fingers shaking at the same time? Lost it?Hopefully will improve.P.sI was also sick too..

s," [Lifting injuries are a common cause](https://grangephysiotherapy.com.au/) of back pain. You can protect yourself against damage with good lifting habits, both at home and in the workplace.**How Lifting Can Injure Your Spine**When you lift, your spine is put under stress. Twisting or jerking while lifting and carrying can injure the small joints of the spine. The discs which separate the vertebrae (spinal bones) and the ligaments which hold the vertebrae together are also at risk. The discs are composed of a jelly-like core, surrounded by a strong fibrous ring. With repeated unsafe lifting, the fibrous ring or its [supporting ligaments may tear or rupture](https://grangephysiotherapy.com.au/). This is commonly known as a disc bulge or herniation.Heavy lifting while bent forward will increase the stress on your spine. Contributing to this stress are factors like the weight of the load, how far it is held from your body, how often and how fast you lift and how long you hold the load.* To protect your spine from injury, always attempt to take the following steps:Get a firm footing with your feet apart for a stable base.* Bend your hips and knees instead of bending at the waist. This allows the leg muscles to take some of the load and not the spine.* Tighten your abdominal muscles. Abdominal muscles support the spine when lifting.* Ensure that you have a strong grip and that the load is as close to you as possible.* The closer it is to your spine the less force it exerts on your back.* Brace yourself for the lift but continue to breathe normally through the lift.* Lift steadily and do not jerk the load.[ Look straight ahead, not down](https://grangephysiotherapy.com.au/).* Keep your back straight and avoid twisting or bending to the side.* To lower the object, place your feet as you did to lift, tighten stomach muscles and bend your hips and knees.",0.553546,0.651215,0.672523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2508038585209003

s,Hi so my my 15 year old brother was with his friends at school and they were playing a game where they would lie down onto the floor and the friends would fall on their back anyway I came back home after a long day. my mother and father both work very tired and sleeping. my brother told me that he was with the nurse for four hours initially I dismissed that because it was 10pm so then what happens is Later he tells me that he was blinded at school for 10 minutes he tells me then that his tailbone is in pain and his lower back hurts him when he stands up. I’m going to take him to the doctors today to see what happens however I am disappointed that my parents didn’t really f involved right now because there is a lot of financial pressure on us. I’m really worried about my brother I don’t want anything long-term or chronic to develop in I feel like I just need some advice because I also have my other life pressures occurring right now. I’m really disappointed that nobody took him seriously including his squadders the fact that a teenage boy was buying it for 10 minutes should have been taken much more seriously and should have had inflicted the measures upon the people that were involved in pushing him even though it was a joke.Anything that you will say will be highly appreciated thank you.

c,"&gt;I've read over and wiki on losing weight + gaining muscle, but still unsure on the best approach. &gt; &gt;Late 20s female, 5'2, 106 pounds. I am definitely on the skinny side but have managed to accumulate an unsightly belly bulge. Yes I know I can't target where I lose fat, so over the summer, I tried to lose weight overall but I really don't have a lot of fat anywhere else. So my question is - what is the best way to lose the belly area while gaining muscle overall on my body? (ie. Do i focus first on gaining more body fat first then work on the muscle portion? wouldnt all the fat just go to my belly? )Also - I have pretty bad back pain sometimes, would building more muscle on my back improve this? &gt; &gt;I'm in med school so I can only spare 3 days a week / 45 minutes per the 3 days to work out for the next few months to start. Also looking for diet tips - my diet is all over the place. Thanks for helping this noob! Unfortunately genetics dictates where your fat will go. For me and you both it's low belly.   I'd suggest eating at maintenance calories and ensuring you get enough protein. I wouldn't stress over any other macros.  Then you'll want to find a good 3 day full body program that fits your schedule and goals. It's a long process so be patient with yourself.

c,"I've been struggling with back pain for the last decade with a herniated L4/5 disc. I had a microdiscetomy in 2013 when the sciatic pain in my leg was absolutely unbearable. When I would get out of bed in the morning I would collapse in pain as it felt someone lit the inside of leg on fire. I felt 100% better after the surgery. But over time have started to re-herniate.  Probably because I went back to my normal things like lifting weights(which is what gave me the bad disc in the first place when I improperly bent at the waist rather than the knees). I also continued to ride bicycles regularly.  The pain would come and go, sometimes very bad, some days barely noticeable. It was all over the place. Doing stretches and some core exercises were typically all I needed for relief. Then last October my back pain got progressively worse and wasn't going away with stretches like normal. I then decided to lay on the floor and do the McKenzie stretch. It seemed at that point I blew something. My back was extremely sore after doing it and then I needed to out and run some errands. When I started driving sciatic pain go so bad I couldn't sit. I had to pull over into a parking lot and walk around a bit and then lay on the back seat of the car. From that point on I could not be in a sitting position anymore without excruciating sciatic pain in my right leg. I had to take a 2 month medical leave of absence form work as I'm have an office job which requires sitting. I could not perform my duties. I got an MRI confirming a re-herniation and was put on some steroids, got spinal epidural injection and started physical therapy. By the end of last year I was feeling okay enough to work again. Still had back pain but the sciatica wasn't there. Fast forward around the beginning of this month and the pain came back with a vengeance. I know what triggered it. I bought a new road bike. And I was riding it fairly frequently and going fairly long distance rides. 20-30 miles. The road bike has you in a more leaning forward aggressive position when you ride which arches your back. After doing a 30+ mile ride part way through my back was stiffing up so bad I could barely get off and on the bike, though actually peddling didn't hurt. It then got worse from there and once again the sciatic has been so bad I haven't been able to go to the office in several weeks. I've been working from home while laying in bed on my laptop.  &amp;#x200B; Anyway, the point of saying all that is that cycling is my favorite hobby. Been doing it since I was a teen. Mostly mountain biking before, but just this year finally got into road biking which I loved. Spent a nice chunk of change on a nice bike and gear and now I may be facing the possibility of having to give it up my favorite thing to do on a nice day. Obviously no more gym as weights put stress on the spine. Can't jog either. So my options for fitness and cardio are extremely limited. All I can do at this point is take a walk.

c,"I cried much more in middle/high school, and I nearly stopped when I got to college because there was no privacy. It's mainly only happened because of stress/frustration over schoolwork. Since I was really little I've been aware of how important it is for me to cry periodically, whether or not I'm particularly upset. However, it's very rare for me to cry around others, even my closest friends.  That being said, I'm trying to bring crying back into my routine. I've recently read about/realized how avoiding emotional expression is causing me a lot of different issues issues (back pain, stomach issues, generalized anxiety, vasovagal syncope, etc) as a way to distract me and prevent some emotional outburst. So I'm trying to really lean into the need to cry whenever I feel it, even if it's over something little.  For instance, I had a very weird/exhausting/dissociative day yesterday and last night I was texting with this guy I'm casually seeing and telling him about the odd place I was in. He was being very genuine, supportive, and considerate, and I told my roommate some of the sweet things he'd said and we both teared up. It's small, and I could probably use a much bigger cry, but it felt good to just show how I felt. I'm still working on loosening up.  EDIT: I also tend to really appreciate when people come to me crying. I have a strong need to feel like people trust me (as I'm a super trusting person) and it means a lot when people are willing to be vulnerable with me. Usually when I'm in need of a good cry for no reason, I'm wishing I could cuddle up with someone and just silently cry together. It's only happened for me twice but it felt so healing. 2ND EDIT: I keep remembering things as I read people's comments! One of the biggest cries I had this year was with my dad. We were talking about my various issues (mentioned some above) and how much they impact my life and he started crying because he said it makes him really sad to see me limited by these different factors and he wishes I could be free from suffering and live my life the way I want to. My dad is generally very goofy and not at all quick to tears but as soon as he started crying I couldn't help it.

c,"(1/3) My due date was 1/21/14. But by 37 weeks I was READY for this baby boy to be born. At my 37+4 checkup, curiosity got me and I consented to a cervical check (my OB was awesome, she did tell me the results would mean nothing and completely left it up to me if I wanted any at all). Turns out I was 2 cm and 50% effaced! And baby was -rightthere-! Queue happy dance! After that appointment, my next stop was the nail salon for a mani/pedi…juuuust in case this was my last chance. I didn't start any wives tales inductions until after 38 weeks, and even then I felt bad for wanting to kick the little guy out. But it was more I wanted to meet the kid, not as much as I want this kid out. That weekend hubs and I began the ""walk this baby out"" mission. Our puppers was happy, she got extra walks and was nice and worn out at the end of the day. We walked at least 3 hours per day (1-1.5hrs a time, however much I could go). Most of it was through our neighborhood, and we did walk the mall one day. On 1/4/14 we had maternity photos, walked around for another 1.5hrs, which was exhausting, but enjoyable at the same time. I was waddling pretty noticeably by this point in my pregnancy. But standing for long periods of time (more than 5 minutes) brought on the back pain, my jeans were tight because nothing fit me anymore anyways, and I felt so stuffed. Oh and I as burning up! Thank you January Texas weather.  On 1/10/14, I started to have painless contractions (or BH? I'm still confused) at ~20/25 minutes apart. Nothing made them stronger or closer together. They would go away when I would lie down. Boo! On Sunday 1/12/14 I woke up with a cold. I felt miserable, and had so many boogers I felt like I was drowning. My nose would drip like a faucet, but when I tried to blow it, nothing would come out. Now that I think back on it, hard nose blowing should be added to the wives takes of inductions. Because I hate sniffling and mouth breathing, so I BLEW my nose for those sweet 5 seconds of nasal relief. That night I got a yoga ball and it was the best decision EVER! My hips loved me for sitting on that thing. Because of the cold and the prodromal labor, I decided to start my maternity leave on 1/13/14 (Monday). I just felt miserable. The previous week, I had done pretty much NOTHING productive at work except think of having this baby!! So on 1/12/14 (Sunday) I sent all the necessary emails to get started, and felt more at ease (not having to drive while 9 1/2 months pregnant, no having to sit around for 9 hours a day being unproductive). That Monday all I did all day was eat, bounce on the yoga ball and blow my nose while watching a marathon of Law and Order (SVU, of course). I think that made baby say ""ENOUGH! I'll come out now"". Around 8pm I laid down on the couch till hubs came home from work at 1:30am. I stayed up with him for a while, and at 3am, we decide it's time for bed. I go pee before climbing into bed, and whaddaya know? Some blood on the TP. Bloody show? YES! Hubs is fast asleep by this point (I’m sure he was out as soon as his head hit the pillow).

Now, I have to wait for the remaining reimbursement via check in the mail.The next (and current) mattress we have tried is the Bear Hybrid mattress. It has been pretty awful for both of us.

s,"So I’ve been using CBD capsules for about 3 and a half weeks, and started vaping a week ago. I’ve been dealing with sleeping issues, in addition to chronic back pain and migraines. I have to say, as a pretty active person, it was a desperation move for me. Considering that it’s an unregulated market and you never quite know what you’re gonna get. I did about a month of research. The RX meds were started by to pile up and get more expensive. I need to pass urinalysis tests in the next few weeks for employment and volunteer activities (Special Olympics and Coast Guard Reserve) so that’s been a huge fear. I tried to get my supply from dispensaries that used independent labs.I have to say, they’ve been incredibly effective as a pain reliever, appetite reducer and sleep aide. I’ve lost 9 pounds in the last 3 weeks, but most importantly my sleep has been a lot more sound. Most importantly, I’ve regained function. Recently I’ve gotten a lot of bad news, according to my neurologist, my spine appears like it’s one of a 60 year old man, which is bad because I’m 19. I need to see an orthopedist and physical therapist 3 times a week and surgery may soon be on the table. But the CBD has made everything so much easier. So today I received my home testing kit for THC, and I tested negative which was such a relief. The CBD is helping wonderfully. Which all I can ask for right now.

c,"&gt; I know it's a cardinal sin, but I don't track macros very strictly if at all. I don't track either. However, I'm not having issues. If you're having problems, you need to track to see if that's where the issue is. I know you say you're eating enough, but track it for like 2 weeks and then assess. Particularly, make sure you're eating quality foods, not supplements. From your OP, the only thing you've explicitly mentioned is supplements like psyllium husk, mio, etc. Sounds like you're sleeping enough. But maybe there's a quality of sleep issue. Consider taking steps to improve quality of sleep. &gt; The psyllium husk is helpful and the collagen helps with back pain. You could drink bone broth. Or just eat some chuck steak. Or make some nice meaty stew with bones. Good source of collagen, and a lot of extra stuff.

I get stuck working late sometimes too. I just push my workout later and dinner later. It isn't ideal, but nothing in life is. But gotta make it work. If you really want to make it work in the AM, consider a scoop of protein in coffee or something, and a longer warm up. It's not completely fasted, but that also may help.

s,"I'm highly considering just not getting my next Lupron shot, after jumping through hoops to get financial assistance from the manufacturer because my insurance doesn't cover it. The injection is already ordered, already at the doctor's office waiting for me. I was initially supposed to get it on April 29, but I'm obnoxiously concerned about myself being a covid risk to other patients because I'm an ""essential worker"" (not really, I'm an office worker at a bank and my role isn't important at all to keeping the country running, but that's a discussion for a different time), and I take public transportation, so if I haven't come into contact with it yet, it's an absolute miracle. My new appointment is May 20th, but I'm toying with canceling it. It's eliminated my GI symptoms, my sciatica is gone, but my daily pain is only somewhat suppressed. I had a 1-month shot back in October and it eliminated all of my pain, but the 3-month never did. My normal daily 6-8/10 pain is reduced to 3-5/10, and I don't know if that's worth it. I don't have the typical side effects - no night sweats, no hot flashes, no hair loss. But the side effects that I do have, oof. The 1-month shot gave me a mild (1.5/10) migraine that didn't go away the whole time I was on it, so I have to take an additional progesterone pill while on the 3-month shot to prevent the headaches. I'm so bitchy and combative, I just want to fight with everyone. And on both the 1-month and the 3-month shot, I have the most frustrating vulva pain. It hurts to sit, it hurts to walk, it hurts to have clothes on. I don't typically cry from pain, but this has had me crying on numerous occasions, including a couple weeks ago when a three-block walk to the bus stop was so miserable that I was scream-crying quite loudly. My gyn has responded by giving me a ""vaginal skin care guide"" they typically give people, but it didn't contain any new information that I haven't already been following. I even went to urgent care a couple months ago because the pain was so bad, but they couldn't see any signs of irritation and wouldn't even give me a topical pain reliever like I'd requested, saying that it's too sensitive of an area to use something like that on. I *can* manage to alleviate/prevent the pain by applying gobs and gobs of vaseline every day, but it's so messy, I wish I didn't have to. And one of the more minor but still annoying side effects, my vaginal smell is very different from my normal. It doesn't smell bad, it doesn't smell like I have an infection, but it smells so different from how I have ever smelled that it's just disconcerting. Still, my side effects are mostly manageable and nowhere near as bad as some people's are, and it does help all of my symptoms to a degree at the very least. I feel silly for wanting to stop taking it for such minor reasons, especially since I live in Iowa and our governor is handling COVID so terribly that the chance of being able to get excision anytime soon is basically null, even if I were able to find a doctor willing to do one (they really don't want to operate on me, it's bonkers). And this could be all in my head, but this week the vulva pain isn't as extreme, and my vaginal scent is getting closer to ""normal"" as the shot begins to wear off.",0.0,0.689261,0.539571,0.532715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21652892561983472

While I wouldn't say my marriage is perfect, or that I don't have complaints, I would say that my wife and I are far from on the rocks. Especially these past six months we have gotten along very well and I genuinely hope to keep it that way.  Two nights ago, I had a sore back. I've suffered from back pain since I was in my late teens so this isn't exactly the most uncommon occurrence. I called my usual massage therapist, a man, and asked if he could fit me in, but he was packed and said it would have to wait. My back on the other hand was really flaring up and I wanted some form of relief, so I searched for ""(my city) massage"" and just picked the closest one from my workplace. I got to the massage place and I should have recognized the red flags immediately. The woman at the counter was young, and after I paid, she took me right into a private room. She told me to disrobe and wait on the table. I asked if I could keep my underwear on and she said yes. I figured this made it clear that I was a ""NO HANDJOB"" customer. The masseuse came in. She was another young woman. She started kneading my back and for 45 minutes, we had a great conversation about sports, fitness, and work. I was immensely relieved because it was just a normal massage, and she was clearly a trained masseuse. She pulled my underwear down *slightly* to get my lower back, exposing my plumber's buttcrack to her, but otherwise it seemed to be professional. She had my roll over then and started working on my front shoulders (as my usual guy always does).  Over the next few minutes she started working down, and suddenly she was touching my penis through my underwear. I completely froze and didn't know what to say without it being awkward. She gave me a handjob in dead silence and I couldn't stop her. I didn't enjoy it at all and she only really noticed my feeling until after it was finished. She hugged me when I left and that was all. I went home and acted as normally as I could. I couldn't possibly tell my wife; it would tear her apart. We have similar views on cheating and I would be breaking down the door of the massage parlor if something like this happened to her. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

s,"Context: Last year my grandmother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She wasn't supposed to live past 2 months and has now lived to her 70th bday. I love her dearly and love spending time with her. She may not agree with everything I do but she's finally decided to stop bringing that up so our relationship is much better now. For her bday, my mom wanted to take her on a shopping trip with me. I hate shopping (anxiety) but I agreed because I love her more than I hate shopping.

I can't stand for 30 min without super bad pain. Normally it wouldn't be such an issue but I have such a tiny frame and such large tits, I have difficulty supporting the weight without a fitting bra. My mother is flat as a board but she also had back problems. My grandma does not know I have difficulty standing for long periods of time.The day comes. I hate shopping but it was nice seeing my grandma so happy. 30 min pass, my back is starting to hurt but I sucked it up. An hour passed, my back was in shambles but grandma was having fun so I continued to suck it up. We were there from 2:30-6:30. Come about 4:30 my back is killing me and I'm having difficulty breathing so I look for a place to sit down. It doesn't help. So I went to my mom privately to tell her I needed to go home. She would not let me leave. At this point I am in tears, the pain was awful. I looked everywhere in the store in hopes of finding something my size but they didn't carry it. Went to the bathroom and stretched in every way I could but nothing was helping. Tears are streaming down my face. It was awful. I came out of there again and asked my mom to let me leave. She would not do it. I asked her privately for 2 HOURS to go home but she wouldn't let me. The last time I asked her, she told me to ""buck up"".

Grandma notices I'm on the verge of tears around 6:30 and tells my mom to take us all home. Mom argues back but eventually complied. My grandmother knows I hate shopping so when she noticed I looked like death, we all went home. This situation was by no means her fault. I kept hiding my face from her so she could enjoy her 70th bday.We got home, mom pulled me into another room and started screaming at me saying that this could have been my grandmother's last birthday and I just ruined it for her because of my ""back issues"" then she told me that there's no way that boobs could hurt that badly to where I could start crying. (Once again, she is barely an A cup) then told me about all the sacrifices her and and grandmother made for my special day and got all mad I couldn't go this one thing.

I had scoliosis and braces and glasses and a weird body composition and a strange speaking voice (people used to always tell me I talked like a white guy in contrast to my very dark skin - I even heard it in a sort complementary way from teachers, which I think contributed to some of the internalized racism I deal with sometimes). I wasn’t cool and I never dated. Things weren’t all bad. I had a loving family and I had music (I liked singing and was considered pretty decent at it - went to some state choirs and thought that was my thing for a while. I wish it was my thing) and I had some friends. I was able to find some redeeming qualities in myself and hadn’t yet learned how to hate myself.  In college, I joined a fraternity but I was always the ugly, weird guy in the house that girls would never want to be around. I’ve been gay for as long as I can remember but tried really hard to be into girls - when that didn’t work (both ‘cause of gayness and ‘cause I am a fairly disgusting human being to be around) I finally gave in and started having my gay sexual experiences - but they were all empty and with other desperate people (random old guys on Grindr and Scruff). I didn’t tell anyone ‘cause I hated it and I still hate it. I finally told my parents and although they are awesome, I know I’m never going to have their support in getting married to a man from anyone in my family. My gayness is the shitty elephant in the room that they know is there but don’t really want to address or talk about. I’m never going to give them a biological grandchild. And it’s not ‘cause I don’t want to. I really really do - but I can’t. I hate it. I’m 28 now and work in a job that I’m terrible at (like every job I take). I’ve worked at the same Fortune 500 company for 5 years and have very little to show for it (my salary has only gone up 15k since I started). After getting furloughed ‘cause of COVID, I moved to a new city to take a job at the corporate office (for less pay and less benefits - I was supposed to get an car package so I bought a new car only to get furloughed and that benefit revoked a week later and now am in even more debt than I was in before). It’s been 3 months and I’m pretty sure my boss is nice to my face but doesn’t really like me at all. I hate the industry I’m in but I don’t feel like I have any transferable skills and don’t even know the first thing about getting into a career doing something that I actually want to do. I’m going to be stuck at this company until they fire and then I don’t know where I’ll go. I’m 70K in student loan debt, so I’m literally worth less than a dollar. If I died,  my parents would have to pay my loans. I’m fat (210 - 220 lbs) and short (5’ 6”) and hate my body and deal with chronic back pain because I can’t commit to losing weight again (I used to be a below average gym rat, but messed up by back squatting [the weight just exacerbates the problem] and now I don’t go anymore. I’ve tried to start again but I just can’t seem to do it - I think I’m scared of hurting myself again)I idolize people with bodies I don’t have and can’t bring myself to do the work to get. I try and fail at a diet or eating strategy every other week. I’ve hired personal trainers only to ditch them after not actually going to the gym. I like music but have never actually made any real music of my own - I’ve barely even tried. I don’t support any ‘causes, I don’t help people. I don’t do anything but go to work, fail, come home and lay around and tell myself how much of a waste of a human being I am. I can’t finish anything that I start (I literally can’t even finish tv shows and video games). I’m always late and tired and never get things done when they need to get done. I have bursts of trying really hard (this week I worked 65 hours because I told myself that I need to stop complaining and put in the work) but I always fall back into bad habits and waste more time than I have any right to. If someone better than me had the time and resources I did, they would probably be able to do great things - I’m me, so I’ve done nothingI don’t want to feel this way about myself - I want to like myself and feel accomplished and leave a favorable legacy and have a positive impact on people’s lives. I want to be happy. I want to be successful and do things that fulfill. I want to change but I don’t know where to actually start because I feel like every piece of my life needs to be overhauled. I’m scared I’m going to be like this forever. The worst part of it is that I don’t feel like I even deserve to be so upset about my life. There are people in such dire situations. I live in a first world country, in a decent apartment, am employed, with health insurance, and a loving family, and even some friends in other states. I have resources. The problem is fully me.

c,"I'm sorry you're going through this. I've had my own burnout 2 years ago. Here's some tips that got me going.  Burnouts are also usually the result of ignoring your bodily cues for rest so... perhaps the first thing you should do is to prioritise rest  https://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/types-of-rest/ I'm not affiliated to her but heard her speak and it made sense to me. There's a quiz in that page that should help you identify the type of rest (according to her there are 7 types of rest) you need.  Healing burnout is really also about rebuilding your energy. Use this time to rewire brain and yourself, prioritising your needs first. If you need to see a therapist - do it. It seriously speeds up the process of healing too. After a burnout, your body has basically gone through a really really tough time and is telling you to stop. The ""fuse of resilience"" gets shorter and your body will not be able to take on as much stress (mental, physical, etc) as before so practice some positive self talk and self love.  Basic self care is not about bubble baths and fine cheese. It's about making sure you keep your maintain your basics well.  In this state you're going to need more sleep than usual and that's normal. Your body needs sleep to heal so don't be surprised if you need 10 hours a night for quite a while! Then focus on your food. Eat as healthy as you can and try to avoid too much caffeine or sugar. If you're working out, get your protein covered :)  Ensure you have your other life-basics covered. bills paid, medical appts met, basic grooming (hair cut) and proper hygiene. I went to visit all the doctors and health specialists I was avoiding for years and learned how to manage my back pain better after seeing a chiro. My burnout was also my trigger for starting to see a therapist.  I also started journalling cos it helped me unravel all the negative beliefs and confused chatter going on in my head. If you're not a journal person, that's fine. Find your own way to think. Maybe it's through quiet walks, or meditation... You do you.  If all these sounds overwhelming, focus on the basics as a starting- your sleep, nutrition and perhaps some low-impact exercise that's easy on your weary body.  Seriously, this is going to take some time and patience and it might even become a recurring thing. It's really easy to fall back on old habits once you start to gain a bit of energy again.  All the best to you. 🙏 Ps: I'm not a therapist or counselor - I just had my own breakdown 2 years ago and am finding my footing now. So I hope this advice helps you.

s,"Yesterday was my first time ever doing DXM and although the drug *felt* kind of like how I expected it to, what I didn't expect was to have such a healthy and wholesome day using a drug that has quite a harsh stigma against it.  I downed the 3 robotablets at 10am then started to set up my music and games to play on my computer while sipping on some ginger tea (I get heavy nausea with LSD so I was a bit nervous using DXM). I started playing some slay the spire for a few minutes but as soon as I notice the DXM taking effect (about 15 minutes in) I felt the urge to look after my body (I have pretty bad back pain). Without hesitation, I close my game and open up a 30 minute yoga video and just like that I've set the pace for a really good day. During the yoga I kept trying to notice the onset of new bodily sensations and changes in headspace but after a while I thought it would be cooler if I just tried to clear my mind and let everything creep up on me without analysing it all, so thats what I did. The yoga went by really quickly and at the end of the practice, lying in corpse pose I allowed myself to feel and reflect on this warmth in my head that I'd been developing over time and I felt good.  I was tired so I put some music on and played a game of teamfight tactics. It was at this point that I noticed that focusing my eyes was a bit difficult, then I realised that it took me a while to get that realisation out and thus I realised that focusing my thoughts was difficult too xD Playing tft was a little challenging because of this - I think I played similarly to how I normally would have, but I always thought about what I was gonna do for the whole round and had to frantically do everything a few seconds before my time ran out. I ended up winning the game with a big brain transition selling my 3 star chosen Elise and getting a chosen dusk Riven and putting in mystic 4 against a Veigar player. I was really stoked to win :)   Immediately after the game some friends showed up at my door and I went and talked to them with confidence which might not sound like much but this felt pretty huge for me. I typically don't like talking to people while I'm on drugs (this includes mdma believe it or not, so I can assure you this was bizarre for me). They were only over for 5 minutes or so until they left.   I'm feeling really talkative at this point and I started to talk my girlfriend's ears off. In this excitable state I tended to lose my train of thought more easily than when in casual conversation with my friends at the door. I suggested we go for a walk because I wanted to continue being healthy and she was keen. On our walk I remember telling her about how I understand the teleporting on DXM thing even though I was no where near close to feeling it properly, and occasionally I would say something like ""if I were on a higher dose I would have teleported just then"".  When we got home I decided to smoke a half cone of weed because I've read so much about how its a great combo and potentiator and I felt like I was already coming off of the peak of the DXM. For the rest of my trip I worked on a piece of art that I started a while back (I'll post a pic tonight or tomorrow when its done). I only took breaks from drawing to do meditation (wim hof method - which I spend about 25 minutes doing all up), talk to/massage my girlfriend (She looked hotter to me on DXM than she does on any other drug and I was feeling crazy horny), and to stretch.  Normally on weed, self doubts and insecurities wiggle their way into my head. I noticed that with this combo, they still did, BUT, they didn't linger. It was like a negative thought would pop into my mind and then without hesitation I'd be like that's ridiculous and the thought would just vanish. I found this to be really therapeutic and it lead to me having a great afterglow when the drug wore off later in the afternoon.  Working on art was crazy fun too. Any idea that popped into my head was considered worthy to be implemented into my art and I went down a lot of paths that were really fun that I otherwise might not have.  The wim hof meditation I did was also really cool. During the breath hold I would become really fuzzy in my body and it was generally pretty easy to let go of thoughts. After inhalation that fuzziness turned into a feeling of heat and I envisioned myself as a sun getting hotter and becoming more condensed until eventually I would automatically exhale when it felt right to do so and it felt like I shrunk down to the size of a pebble and then exploded (really euphoric). It was interesting though because I have done the wim hof method a lot and it feels really good to me while sober as well (not as intense though), but doing it on weedxm the good feeling following that last exhalation was very short lived (like 2 seconds to match the explosion visualisation).   The only time I noticed any visuals was after this when I opened my eyes. Things sort of looked like they were flowing away from me. At some point when I blinked I started laughing because just as I had gotten used to them flowing away they started flowing towards me (very mild visuals). This was also the only time I felt any nausea on the trip and it was only for about 5 seconds. I think as soon as I realised I was hungry the nausea went away.  I almost forgot but I also watched 2 tier zoo videos (guy makes nature documentary type videos but talks about all the animals' traits using gaming terminology). This was probably the coolest part of the trip for me. I felt like I understood evolution so deeply. Like it just made heaps of sense to me how like a brightly coloured plant or animal would be something to avoid. They're like flaunting their presence instead of optimising for camouflage with darker colours. That flaunted presence sort of implies that it would be super obvious to not touch or go near them because of venoms or poisons or whatever.  By mid-later afternoon I'm feeling sober, but I'm feeling good. I walk over to my friend's place and tell him about my day and ask him if he wants to go for a run (we've never run together before). We go for a run and chat, and while chatting he said he thought I seemed like I was feeling really good even before I told him I did DXM. We go back to my place and do a wim hof meditation for 15 minutes (my girlfriend joined too). Idk how the vibe got so goofy but after each of the three last rounds we all cracked up laughing uncontrollably. I felt so grateful not only to have had such a wholesome day but to have a friend and a girlfriend who were keen to do wholesome healthy things with me like meditation and running, and to like do it all with a 'have fun with it kind of attitude'.  Looking forward to doing 4 robotablets next time I try this substance :) I'm also looking forward to eventually doing a second plat dose and having a more *traditional* DXM experience ;)  Thanks for reading, I love you all, and stay safe &lt;3",0.631386,0.562098,0.859901,0.694001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15824665676077265

It felt a bit more strain on my quads.I am thinking that I still could use to open up my chest a bit more to keep it up, but otherwise I feel like the arch is better and i didn't bounce.

c,"After that happened I was afraid to try walking in my neighborhood again because my health was so poor that I couldn't predict how far I could go.  My backyard is good size so I started walking around the swimming pool. That way I'm never far from home!  I also have fibromyalgia and several other medical problems, so it's important for me to try to exercise, but it's very difficult.   I'm sorry I can't really answer your question. But what I can tell you is that if you haven't tried pool therapy yet it can be really helpful. I thought it was wonderful- the water is around 98% and it feels so good, plus the buoyancy of the water makes moving less painful.  Once I was stronger they moved me to regular physical therapy.    The other thing that has really helped me is a procedure my pain management doctor does called Radiofrequency Neurotomy for Facet and Sacroiliac Joint Pain (my pain is in the lumbar region).  That's two procedures- he does them about six months apart.  He burns the nerves in those areas.  First he tried the sacroiliac and I had good results so then he did the facet joints. He gives me injections into the facet joints at the same time (six shots, three on each side).  For the first part of the procedure they just give me enough anesthesia to make me sleepy while he pokes me with needles to try to find were the pain is and which nerves to burn.  Then they put me completely out for the burning.  The nerves grow back in around a year, but during that time I have much less pain.  Unfortunately, even with pain meds the pain never completely goes away due to the fibromyalgia and other medical problems.  But these procedures have helped more than anything else I've tried.  Go to Spine-health.com for a better explanation and photos.  It's a great site with all kinds of info related to back pain.    Good luck to you- I hope you find some relief.  I know it can be very frustrating and depressing.  Working with a good pain management doctor and a physical therapist has made a huge difference in my life.

c,"&gt; Are you following strong lifts? I am more-or-less doing Starting Strength. I've yet to incorporate bent-over row or any accessory work, though. &gt; Do you squat low-bar or high-bar? My upper body flexibility isn't quite where I'd like it to be, so I tend to squat more high-bar than low-bar. I try to get it as low as possible, but that doesn't end up being very far - I feel like some of the fat in my shoulders/upper back contribute to a lack of flexibility there. &gt; Someone ""your size"" or any size really doesn't need more than 3g of creatine a day. Excess creatine is known to cause bloating (caused by water retention). Bloat is fine - assuming the bloat stays more-or-less static with a constant creatine intake, I would expect it to have no change on the rate of fat loss I experience. I used to take 5g/day, but upped it to 10g after reading a few articles on various bodybuilding websites - 3g comes as a surprise to me. &gt; Do you ever cheat (carb-up) / when is the last time you had a carb-up? The last time I had over 100g carbs in a day was around the first few days of January. I maintain a relatively clean diet, avoid junk food, processed garbage, and don't go out to eat unless I'm getting some sashimi, which is just as clean as my normal diet. I occasionally get ~50g on weekend days, but weekdays are very tight at &lt;20g. I have partially demoted my social life to hermit status and have quit toking in order to achieve this; both have been very effective and I've had great consistency over the past month.  I weighed 274 the day after moving home post-graduation last June; I lost 30 or so pounds half-assing my diet, regressed a bit over the holiday, and have now been back at it giving my 100%. My diet has been clean for quite a long time prior, though - I am quite the longtime lurker to /r/keto, /r/fitness, /r/loseit etc. &gt; Have you read starting strength? The most useful part is learning how to properly lift... If you don't know proper form when you go for high weights you will stall and start to feel soreness/pain in all the wrong places (lower back pain, elbow pain, etc...). How long have you been lifting consistently? I first started practicing the big four in a weightlifting class I took in college; I have lifted inconsistently since then but have done regular check-ups and deloading to keep my form in check. I have read most of Starting Strength, but it's the type of book that requires regular re-reading and I'm probably due for a re-up. I just did a deload on my squat and OHP to coincide with upping my calories and my protein; my form had started to drift slightly but I've since corrected the problem. &gt; At 200lbs you will not have abs because you won't be 200lbs of muscle. Realistically you will see that kind of definition at 165 pounds to 170 pounds. That was intended to be read as progression of goals; 200 lb is my next major milestone, followed by 15% bodyfat, followed by abs, etc.  &gt; Why? Who recommended doing this? Ketosis already mimics the effects of fasting. The guy that does leangains is not a ketogenic dieter. I don't see much of a point of doing this. Habit and preference, mostly. I feel more alert during the day when I don't eat, and skipping lunch lets my work day be 8 hours long and no longer. I also enjoy coming home and gorging on huge, lovingly crafted meals as opposed to eating stuff that I begrudgingly microwave in a Tupperware midday. Couple these with the alleged benefits of Martin's program, and baby, you've got a fast going. &gt; Are you doing stronglifts? Do you understand the concept of ""de-loading""? Yes, see above.

s,"So, at the time I wrote the last post, I was transitioning jobs, and didn't have the resources to invest in a new bike -- CoronaVirus has only made this worse. As a result, I continued with Citi Bike until I got Covid-19, a particularly bad bout that brought back severe asthma I haven't had since a child. I  was out of commission for biking from about mid-February (yes, an early case), to mid-April.During that time, my Citi Bike membership expired.  I had misgivings about using shared bikes any way, but I figured liberal cleaning of the bike/myself, plus the fact that I already had Covid, would be an acceptable risk. I sent their customer service an e-mail; told them my already sparse work had dried up, and asked them if they had any discounts or could renew my IDNYC discount + citi card discount that brought my yearly total down to about $128. They were unhelpful, and that gave me the push I needed to try something else.I bought a fairly cheap, used, steel road bike, a single speed ""Tribe Bicycle"", and have been fiddling/learning about it since then. It is \~25 lbs, compared to citibike's 40+ lbs. Immediately since Covid-19, I noticed my riding capacity went way down. I used to do a loop of Central Park on a citi-bike in 25-26 minutes; my last 3 citibike rides, just for kicks/comparison, (outside of my membership) took me an average of 29-30 minutes each. Now, on the steel road bike, my full internal loop times of the Park started out around 26 minutes in mid-April --  1 Month in, I am down to an avg of 23 minutes, with my best time being under 22.  I think this is about where I was pre-covid, fitness wise. Are these respectable times for a novice on a 25 lb bike? What are the best ways to improve these times? I know nothing about breathing, energy conservation, or even cardio in general as prior to citi-biking, I never did any cardio.I have never been an athletic person, often with poor health, so biking \~30 miles a week now feels like a big accomplishment to me. Still, I'm having a hard time getting used to the posture of a road bike, and, as you all told me, the excitement of this much faster ride already has me wanting a much nicer/lighter/faster bike. Any tips for dealing with wrist pain/hand cramps lower back pain with biking posture?  Right now my handles are the straight, riser-style bars.The good news is I may have a full-time job lining up that I'm actually really excited about and that pays well enough for a little splurging. Fingers crossed. \*I'm wondering, sub-$700, where you all would go from here?\* Should I go used or new? Where is the best place to look for a used bike in NYC?

s,"I suspect my husband (34, 5'3"" and 123 lbs, BMI ~22) has sleep apnea because he's always tired during the day, is prehypertensive, has headaches in the morning and (for some reason) leg twitching at night as he's falling asleep and lower back pain. He is a light, restless sleeper and also makes a weird clicking sound sometimes as he sleeps. Google tells me it might be some sort of throat spasm. I was terrified my husband would die in his sleep while we're busy fighting insurance to approve his sleep study (it's been two months and it's still going on. Insurance wants to only cover a home study but his physician keeps insisting on a lab study) so my uncle mailed us his old CPAP. It's a ResMed Airsense S9 Autoset with a heated tube. I also ordered him a DreamWear nasal pillow mask on Amazon. Last night was his first night using it. He was so tired he clocked out at 7 PM, which is not unusual for him unfortunately. During the night, as I lay beside him, I noticed that while he was not snoring at all, his breathing would occasionally become what I can only describe as increasingly more labored, and then after a few moments, his breathing paused, he made a clicking sound, stirred and rolled over and was immediately asleep again. Identical to what seemed like an apnea episode before he had his CPAP, except of course there was no snoring. Disturbed, I quietly crept over, opened the clinician setting on his macine, and cranked the minimum pressure from 10 to 13. I know, I probably shouldn't have done that, but we have no idea yet what pressure he needs. He was even more restless after that, presumably because it's hard to fall back to sleep when you have a sudden hurricane in your nose. I was too nervous watching him toss and turn to even attempt sleeping beside him, so I retired to the couch and eventually slept there. He woke up at his usual time and said he couldn't tell if the CPAP had made any difference, because he didn't feel any more or less tired than usual. I immediately plugged his SD card into SleepyHead and it showed his AHI as 2.9, so that's okay. Mostly. Most of his apneas were central or clear airway apneas, a few were hypopneas, and he had one full OA that night. He's been at work a few hours now and he says he can't tell whether he feels any better or worse than usual, but he's not tired. He says no headaches or backaches this morning.  I am not sure what to make of it but at least I know he's not in danger of asphyxiating in his sleep. We cannot wait for that sleep study. ",0.0,0.537982,0.853802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2563559322033898

c,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.*** Long, long background that I'll shove into a few sentences. I'm 18F and always sick. I currently see eight doctors. I get very weak at my job and have to leave early constantly. I asked my manager for shorter shifts (like 6 hours) and she responded by scheduling me 8 1/2 to 10 hour shifts on the busiest days while still keeping me from getting overtime. She also schedules me to close because she knows I won't leave early no matter how bad I feel because I hate making other people do my  job. Luckily, I've put in my two weeks notice, so I only have to make it until the 31st, but it's still hard. Today I woke up vomiting. I'm currently going through withdrawal because my doctor cut my anxiety/depression meds cold turkey. I also have an extreme case of sciatica. That's along with my usual health problems. And I'm scheduled to close today alone (Sunday is our busiest day. Packed-out-the-door busy. And I'm supposed to close alone). I immediately knew I wouldn't make it to the end of my shift and started calling around for anyone to come take over. I got two people willing to come help me until I reached my limit, and then I could go home and they'd manage on their own. I told my manager that I'm sick and can't stay but I got a replacement, and was told that they needed me to stay. Because I'm such a necessary part of the Crew that my health should come last. So instead of leaving at 11, I made it to 4:30. That's when I hit my absolute limit. If I stayed any longer, I would've collapsed. No escaping it. So I said thanks to my coworkers and clocked out. Then I got yelled at and written up for clocking out without permission. But? I already gave my two weeks notice so getting written up does absolutely nothing to me. And now I'm in bed feeling insanely guilty for taking care of myself. Should I have put my work first? Am I the asshole for leaving early? Tldr; very very sick, left work early, yelled at and written up for abandoning the team. AITA? *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A person wanting larger breasts to look more attractive or smaller breasts to alleviate back pain has nothing to do with being trans.

c,"Hmmmm...native English speaker who knows no German, so I don't know how this will translate, but I'd call the hot tea/lemon/ginger drink a ""home remedy.""  For some illnesses, all you can really do is rest, treat the symptoms, and be watchful for signs that you may need a doctor's intervention (the flu can turn pretty easily into pneumonia, for instance). Home remedies differ from alternative medicine in that they usually have some support from actual, you know, science. Antibiotics aren't going to do a damn thing for a cold, but a doctor might very well tell you that hot tea with lemon is going to help soothe your throat and open up your nasal passages, and ginger helps settle the stomach upset caused by sinus drainage.   Another difference is that they're usually inexpensive, made from common things most people have in the house already or can purchase cheaply.  For example, gargling with warm salt water helps a sore throat (can't remember the science behind that one right now) and you pretty much can't get cheaper than that. They're also usually not hazardous to your health if used properly.  You can make your own hot pack pretty easily; my mother-in-law cut a sleeve off an old cotton jacket, tied one end into a knot, filled it with flaxseed, then tied the other end off.  Heat relaxes tightened muscles, so if I'm having lower back pain from menstrual cramps, I throw that in the microwave for a couple of minutes, put it between my back and and whatever chair I'm sitting in to hold it in place, and relax into the warmth.  Now, if I got it too hot, it might burn me, so I have to be mindful of the temperature.  And while heat relaxes muscles, cold contracts them, so if I had a mildly sprained ankle that was swelling, putting a heat pack on it for initial treatment wouldn't help and might actually increase the swelling. (In that case, you would use a cold pack instead.) Alternative medicine, on the other hand, has little to no scientific basis, is often VERY expensive, and can be quite dangerous *even if used according to its directions* (like here, where people are drinking fucking bleach).

s,"Hi there, so this was my 1st pregnancy and 1st MC.  I miscarried naturally on the 3rd August at 6W+5D and since my period has returned it's no longer painful...I'm wondering if it's a temporary or permanent change. I've noticed the bleeding is heavier (I'm mid way through my 2nd cycle and was surprised how quick it came back)!The actual miscarriage itself was the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life (and I thought my period pains were bad, having suffered for years)!! Here's my story...After experiencing lower back pain, tummy twinges and spotting that gradually got heavier I took myself to A&amp;E to get checked out. 1st thoughts were ectopic pregnancy.  I was given a transvaginal scan and told everything was where it should be and was a viable pregnancy..however what they did discover was what they called 'visualised Bradycardia' a very slow heart beat. They showed me on screen the tiny slow flicker of a heart beat.I was told to come back one week later for another scan to see if the fetal heart rate would increase or stop..I was sent home and woke the next morning to the worst cramps I've ever experienced in my life!! I called the hospital and they just told me to come in at the scheduled time one week later...it was quite clear to me I was having a MC!The pain was unbearable, after 48hrs went by I called the medical team again and challenged them on why I was being dismissed and had to wait until the following week...obvs with the global pandemic they were trying to keep as many people out of hospital as possible.  Long story short I eventually managed to get an appointment after being in excruciating pain for 3 days. The 2nd scan showed that I'd passed the sack but had pregnancy tissue trapped in the neck of my womb, which they told me would be causing a lot of pain. I got sent into another room where a doctor had to insert a speculum to remove the trapped pregnancy tissue/clots from the area with a forcep. Within 10 minutes, they gave me a pack of co-codamol 30/100, told me to take a pregnancy test in 3 weeks and to call them with the results. I was then sent home! I felt like I'd coped with it well but then realized I was struggling to process it. It then hit me emotionally a week later.The tablets worked really well as I was in discomfort, just wish I'd have had those when I was actually miscarrying rather than be given them after. They told me to expect the first period to be painful so I saved the co-codamol for that but didn't end up needing them after all!This is probably going to sound like a really dumb question but has anyone else experienced painfree menstrual cycles after MC..?  My hormones are definitely out of whack still as I found myself feeling super confused at times.I've always suffered with extremely painful periods for years. I took a pregnancy test 3 weeks after my MC and it came back negative. I'm just amazed I didn't need a D&amp;C or Miso. Although I want to try again I'm now prettified of going through a MC again. How do you overcome that?Sorry for the long post, had to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading. Hope this post helps someone.",0.522395,0.649509,0.0,0.541969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22982456140350876
c,"All back pain with the exception of referred pain from non musculoskeletal sources such as kidney disease or colon cancer originate from the SI joint. SI joint dysfunction causes a mechanical scoliosis due to the functional leg length difference caused by the innominate rotation. This results in lumbar facet dysfunction which can also cause thoracic and cervical facet dysfunction. This results in rotated segments which cause pain and place increased stress on areas of the bone which hypertrophy in accordance to Wolf's Law. This is how you get arthritic changes to the spine. The rotated segments will increase strain on discs, especially where segments tend to be rotated in opposite directions such as at L4/5 which cause the disc to eventual fail and herniate. The hips are not aligned properly with innominate rotation causing increase strain on hips as well which can cause hip pain. When joints are not aligned will it causes reflexive muscle contraction causing increased muscle tone. I work at a spine clinic where every patient with low back pain demonstrates SI joint dysfunction and pelvic obliquity. It is a common occurrence to have patients come in with sciatica and leave with complete relief of symptoms. Of course that is only temporary treatment and they need to improve posture and body mechanics to maintain proper alignment which we work on next.",0.0,0.642493,0.0,0.864677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24553571428571427
c,"&gt;Avoid injuries. Use proper form, and listen to your body. That is incredibly vague advice. Here is some more specific advice tailored to someone looking to avoid injuries and prolong their fitness: * don't train till failure (huge cause of injuries and sprains; if this bothers you a lot, compromise for ""don't train till failure on shoulders &amp; chest"" because if you fuck those up they'll haunt you forever) * don't spend more than an hour working out (not counting cardio warmup and dynamic drills) * don't do anything to the extreme (for example, 1000 push ups or something ridiculous like that) unless you're training for a competition like a powerlifting meet or ultra marathon. * get plenty of rest (this means lots of sleep, deload weeks, not training the same muscle till it has recovered) * increase your 1 rep maxes slowly over time (that means don't jump up 20 lbs on your deadlift in a single day) * Maybe even avoid 1 rep maxes in general (lots of injuries are from 1RM attempts) * work all sides and movements of a body part adequately or in a ratio that suits your current weakness (e.g. balance out push with pull, hamstring/glute with quad work, external rotations with internal rotations) this is tricky to figure out without a PT.... * develop a strong core (=/= strong abs) * if you feel like your abs are no longer contracted during heavy lifts or core work and other muscles are ""pitching"" in to make up for the fact that your core has failed, stop that exercise right there. For instance, people often report back pain after doing ab/core exercises; this is most likely because they worked past the point of their core doing most of the work and suddenly their spine is being loaded...same with hip flexors. If during knee/leg raises suddenly your hip flexors are cramping that's because your abs have been exhausted and your butt isn't being moved ""up and forward"" and your hip flexors are doing all the work of raising your legs. Apply this to deadlifts. If suddenly your lower back is unable to keep itself from curving because your lower back, glutes, and spinal erectors are exhausted, what do you think will happen to your spine? * Don't work through pain. By pain  I mean  your shoulder suddenly hurting during a bench press. You don't continue through this pain. Your testosterone might tell you to persevere and finish your set so you don't look like a wuss but you gotta overcome that. You don't move on to the next chest exercise. You go home and rest and hope you didn't fuck up your rotator cuff.  * gets lots of fiber * stick to a legit program  ",0.0,0.660152,0.822264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24183006535947713
c,"About a year and a half ago, I had a very similar injury. Happened while I was deadlifting with Shitty form back in my ""Body Building"" days. It hurt to walk and at times, my back would lock up and leave me immobile in bed. After going to numerous doctors and hearing the same thing over and over again: ""Don't lift. Just be happy you can walk."", I decided that I would take matters into my own hands. I saw a physical therapist one time and took note of everything he did.  After that one visit, I used all the techniques he did in my own home. Electro-Shock Therapy, Icing, and particular stretches. I also continued to research more and more. I found various exercises and stretches that helped me. The first few months, I did super light training. No deadlifting, no squats, only bro training (Biceps and Bench). But I continued doing my own physical therapy and hoping for the best. After those initial first few months, I started to feel better. I didn't do heavy deadlifts and squats until about a year later. But with no belt and super strict form. Side Note: I began to start powerlifting and do strongman movements after my injury.

c,"Oooh! I am such a huge fan of osteopaths.You can kind of think of a PT as a Psychologist or Therapist, but an Osteo is a psychiatrist or a neuro-psychologist with the authority to write prescriptions and more medical intervention experience. Fundamentally, an osteopath's training focuses on looking at the body as a holistic unit instead of discrete problems, manipulations and adjustments are a part of that. They really look at the relationships between all the individual systems and how things work together or fall apart together. For example, I was having excruciating costochondritis and back pain for years, and finally went to see my spine osteopath who immediately identified my problem had nothing at all to do with my back or scoliosis but everything to do with my asthma and incorrect breathing.  My appointment kind of went like this- Come in, blood pressure/ weight/ height/ temp/ initial overview of what's wrong. Doctor + student (it was a teaching hospital) come in and ask me questions about my medical history and current problems. I show them my imaging (or not).  Physical exam. Walk back and forth, range of motion, etc.  Doctor, puts hands on as I go through movements to ID any problems or look at specific features. I get initial diagnosis and treatment plan, follow up for a few weeks later is scheduled. Discuss pain treatment options (pros/ cons of NSAIDs, steroids, painkillers) and physical therapy appointment is scheduled (yes by the doc. in the room. This was highly unusual.)  Finally, he explained the manipulations he was going to do, what to expect in the following days, and what to do at home after my appointment. For me, he popped my ribs back into place and told me to ice them. Eventually, he diagnosed me with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome. Not until I get genetic testing can I be diagnosed as EDS, but it's on the table. In total, my PT for that issue took 18 months to complete and I went through 4 PTs to finally get through it all, because as we fixed one problem, another would arise. I shudder to think about all the steroid injections into my ribs, possible surgery on my scoliosis, months and years more of pain that might have happened had I been treated by an MD alone. I still have chronic pain (I'm actually double fisting heating pads right now) and I'm still in PT 5 years later, but the treatment worked. My costochondritis has been gone for years.

c,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.*** I need to start this with some context about myself (22m). I am, essentially, a barely functioning wreck of a man. By which I mean I suffer pretty hard with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, as well as chronic back pain from a childhood injury and a little clinical depression sprinkled on top to make it extra fun. Make no mistakes: this isn't a pity party and I don't expect sympathy, I just want to be fully transparent on the fact that day to day life is pretty challenging for me sometimes, as this is very relevant to the story. Now, the other person involved here is my brother's (25m) girlfriend (34f). She has no inclination whatsoever towards doing housework or cooking or really much of anything around the house. It's fine when my brother is home because he does it all and enjoys it, but his job requires him to work away a lot, sometimes for up to a week, and when he is away things just don't get done. If I go round to visit my niece (3f) and nephews (9m and 11m) while my brother isn't there, I often end up doing a lot of it because the level of mess that house reaches is unreal. Now, historically I've tried not to judge her bc I didn't know if she maybe had some kind of invisible disability, and lord knows I of all people can't stand being judged for not being able to do things because of my conditions.  However, I recently found out that she *doesn't* have anything that would prevent her from doing stuff, and that she just opts out of doing most of it, bar dishes and laundry. My brother is currently away and I went over yesterday and did a bit of cleaning because the house was a pigsty and cooked lunch for the kids bc they've been living on Pot Noodles and takeout for a week. I kinda gently asked if everything was okay and why she hadn't done much today and she started talking about how she finds cleaning tiring and how she wishes they could afford a maid (note: brother makes ""partner can be a SAHM"" money but not ""hired help"" money). I, in what I thought was an encouraging way, said I understand it's tiring but it's so satisfying to get done and that if my broken ass can manage it, anyone can. She didn't say anything at the time, but later last night my brother rang me and said that his wife had called and said I'd been rude and condescending and she felt spoken down to by me. I feel really bad. That wasn't my intention at all, I truly meant to be encouraging. AITA here? Could I have worded it better? *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

c,"I don't know that you could say an MRI could be 'wrong' as much as you might say that they aren't as perfect as people might think. Everything doesn't always show up on them. The fact that a sciatic nerve is irritated might not create any particular physical changes large enough to visually show on the test. If you look at an MRI, it shows more detail than an X-ray, but is still a little fuzzy around the edges. Contrast dyes and mediums can help improve visibility in certain circumstances, but not all. You might try requesting a referral to a specialist, and discuss with them how the sciatica has changed and/or worsened over the last 2 years. Sciatica can have a number of causes, and therefore finding the correct treatment can require going through the laundry list. A referral to a pain clinic might be helpful. I'm also in Canada. I had an MRI that showed a [vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia](http://www.neuroradiologycases.com/2011/10/vertebrobasilar-dolichoectasia.html) just slightly smaller than the cut-off line for being called 'significant'. My GP in Northern Ontario refused to order a follow-up at the closest hospital 3 hours away. Finally my Neuro at the pain clinic in Toronto had to call her personally and request she get it done locally so that he could see it next time I flew down to see him. She figured that if he wanted the test, he should order it at his hospital. This would force me to fly to Toronto twice within a 30 day period, costing the government (who pays) thousands extra for no good reason. Mind you, this is the same twit who decided that since I was taking mmj, I didn't need other pain killers (I only take 20 tabs a month of one pain killer) that were part of the agreed treatment plan put together by the neuro.

s,"Hello!I apologize for another ""does this sound like AS?"" post, but I've been lurking here for a while and am looking for some advice from people who actually have AS. Quick background: I (28 M) woke up one night in late January with back pain so intense that if I moved at all, it felt like someone was stabbing my lower back with an ice pick. I am also really stiff in the mornings, for at least two hours. The pain and stiffness gradually got a little better until my appointment with my new GP in late April. He suspected AS right off the bat and ordered blood tests and an x-ray, admitting that x-rays are not diagnostic but it's good to see if my vertebrae are in good shape. The blood test results (CBC with auto differential, RF, CCP Antibody, ANA, Sedimentation Rate, C-Reactive Protein) all came back perfectly normal. My x-ray, however, showed that I had minimal facet arthropathy (L4-L5, L5-S1) and straightening of the lumbar lordosis. My doctor specifically mentioned the straightness as something most people with AS have, but he wants me to try physical therapy before doing anything else, like an MRI. The physical therapist was surprised by how stiff my lower back is. She said none of my lower vertebrae were giving any movement when she pressed on them. Since these two appointments, I've had really, really tight quads and calves. I've had weird pins and needles in my feet that comes and goes, but I haven't lost any feeling. The pinky on my right hand feels sorta numb, which also comes and goes. I've got a follow-up appointment with my doctor tomorrow to talk about my new symptoms, and I would like to have another conversation about how this could still be AS or something similar.I guess my question to you all is, in your experiences, is it common to have blood results come back normal and still have AS? He seems pretty set on this not being AS. Do you guys have any tips or recommendations on what to do if I don't improve with physical therapy and my doctor still doesn't want to do an MRI?

Sleeping propped up on pillows for a number of weeks and not being able to lie on your side or chest for quite a while.  * Breast cancer screenings and mammograms are a bitch for people who have implants. When a person without implants get those they literally squish your boobs between two panels, hard, and take about 3 photos with them in different positions. For people who have had an augmentation it's more like 12 photos.  * Loss of sensitivity in the nipple sometimes happens. Normally after the procedure they are numb and sometimes sensation returns, sometimes it doesn't.  * Implants under the muscle will not impact on breast feeding ability. * Depending on what size she gets it's quite possible that she'll suffer from some back pain. * Scarring depends on where the incision is made. To be honest it's one of the smaller issues, the one that's recommended the most is under the curve of the breast. When you go through the arm pit it's harder for the surgeon to position it correctly and once the implant is already in, the natural curvature will hide the scar anyway.  * Depending on your surgeon and post-op care, the breasts may never 'drop'. So you'll end up with the sort of porn star cleavage where it's sort of like two semi circles  sitting horizontally on your chest without getting the vertical cleavage most of us are accustomed to.  * There are many different types of implants, make sure she picks the right one for her look. Never go too big, if you go to the extreme you could actually separate the space between the breasts and create a uniboob. Saw one of those, it was horrible.  * People are still quite scared that silicone implants will leak and then travel and cause clots which technically could kill you. It's unlikely but it's happened. They can also burst sometimes, it's rare but especially if you're in an accident it makes the situation 10x worse. * On the upside if you get them it basically eliminates the need to wear a bra on most days because they do sort of defy gravity. * There's a chance that they might not turn out the way she wanted. A lot of people have cosmetic surgeries where they are unhappy with the result and they need to get it redone or live with the poor results. Maybe you'd get more responses on AskWomen.

c,"As someone who just delivered at 35 weeks due to spontaneous labor, I am almost embarrassed to admit I had a premie as though there is something I may have done to cause the preterm labor. In my specific case, I had the lowest risk pregnancy. Everything was text book, all test results were perfect, we got pregnant immediately, I wasn’t very sick, not even so much as any heartburn despite my son having a full head of hair, weight gain was 20 lbs through 35 weeks so super reasonable. Waters broke at 35w3d and my son was born 10 hours later. The only ‘signs’ I had was a bit of lower back pain and tightness in the front lower portion of my bump the morning of, which I thought was a sign he was dropping. My mom did deliver both myself and my brother a month early and, similar to my son, neither of us needed to be observed or monitored, we passed our newborn tests w flying colors, and went home after 48 hours. Either way, it does stink to wonder if I could have done something differently or better to have prevented preterm labor while knowing that’s not the case.",0.520398,0.630692,0.892958,0.760893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3645320197044335

c,"Oh, Sweetie, I feel your pain. My first child, I had an emergency c-section, and slept the first 12 hours or so after he was born. I didn't get to hold him for 4 hours after he was born. He lactched fine, but he would go right to sleep. Once I got home, my sciatica wouldn't go away and lasted 4 weeks. I was so uncomfortable and he was losing weight. Once I switched to formula I became human again.  My second baby, I had a plan c-section and tried to nurse him too. Didn't get to hold him for several hours (hospital policy). He latched great, but nothing. Saw lactation and still nothing worked. Switched him to formula and never looked back.  Third one, was at a different hospital. He was in my arms and latched on within 30 minutes if being born. Heck, he fell off and before I could get him back on he started to suck on what he could and gave me a bruise he suckled so well. He was on me all the time. (Because that's what they said to do.) I thought, maybe this time would work. Within less than 24 hours of being born he was screaming because he was so darn hungry. So we began to supplement. He would nurse and then get formula. I would pump after every feeding. Did this for a month 24/7. (Pumped every two to three hours) I was miserable. My two older kids were miserable. My husband was miserable. It wasn't working. So I stopped pumping. I offered my breast first, but if he wasn't having it, he got formula.  Now at 7 months he has stopped on his own and I'm so much better for it. In hindsight, I should have stopped the pumping all the time a lot sooner. I was only getting an ounce out of the two side total. I was on all the supplements and eating all the foods that were supposed to increase my supply. Nothing worked!  I did however miss out on enjoying my baby because I was pumping and measuring and eating and drinking water. Even after two previous kids, I got lost in, ""breastfeed or you're a failure"" mentality. But I'm not! My babies are alive and growing and by not breastfeeding I can be completely engaged in them! They are little for such a short time.  I'm still envious of those who can exclusively breastfeed. But not everyone can or wants to do it. It's okay. Do what is best for your family! The choice is simple. Do you want a dead baby or a living baby. If it is breastmilk or formula it doesn't matter. Please take care of yourself too. We get lost in the fog of it all and can suffer because of it. Take time for you and everyone benefits. ",0.574619,0.606168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24217118997912318

When I started deadlifting I started with a mere 95lbs (total, _including_ the bar) with 25lb plates and a wide grip to maximize ROM.  A couple of years later I've added about 15lbs of muscle to my frame and have zero back pain to speak of.

s,"I've posted a few times on here about my situation, but for those unaware I was hit by a car and almost killed about six weeks ago, I've got a rod holding my left leg together and a plate in my neck keeping everything in place so I don't end up a quadraplegic.  I had issues getting proper pain management almost out of the gate, but I finally got in somewhere and had my first appointment today.  It didn't go as well as I had hoped but it wasn't a complete disaster.  I got sent home with a script for 60 Norco 10s.  My issue is that the doctor wrote the dosage for two a day, which is super low for what I'm dealing with.  My last script was for four a day and that was barely enough to take care of the pain when I would be doing nothing but laying in one spot.  I want to start going back to work and need to start doing some more intensive stuff with physical therapy to get my leg back in working condition, but there's no way this dosage is going to manage the pain.  I tried going back to work for a night three weeks ago when I still bad a script for 8-12 a day and I only made it three hours before I had to stop.Now I know the game this doctor is trying to play.  I got scheduled for all kinds of testing today.  MRIs, EKG,  nerve tests, a fucking 24 hour EEG that I actually laughed at when the receptionist told me I needed to schedule a date for.  I know what's wrong with me.  I have specialists for my neck and my leg and the general physical trauma.  There's nothing they're going to diagnose me with that I'm not already diagnosed for.  But this doctor is a jew, literally.  He was wearing a yarmakule when I saw him.  At one time this guy had a very promising career ahead of him.  He's a brit that got his PhD at a very prestigious university in England (I want to say Oxford but I can't remember).  He was on the medical staff at Harvard in the 80s when he got busted by the DEA for selling prescriptions of percosets and shit under the table and on the street.  He got fired from Harvard and had his license suspended until something like 1996.  Now he's running around the Midwest in a private practice out of decrepit office buildinge serving a bunch of trailer trash scripts for phantom back pain.  Talk about a fall from grace.From what I had researched online and the vibes I got today, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have even got a script for these Norcos today if I wasn't all visibly fucked up.  This dude has a bunch of equipment and he's going to make damn sure he's going to use it on everybody who comes through his door.  He is 100% running a business, and I don't even really have a problem with that.  My issue is that he gave me a super low dose to start out with.  This won't even comfortably get me through most days when I'm just sitting around, it's definitely not going to get me through an 8 hour shift at work.  And I need to start drawing checks again.So here's my question.  If I were to call the pain management clinic after the weekend and ask if I could up the dosage to 4 a day, would that fly?  I have another appointment on the 23rd.  I don't want to just start taking all these and then get fucked over for not still having them.in two weeks.  I understand this dude wants you to run through his gambit and charge your insurance for 20 grand before he goes and writes you real scripts, but I'm not there for a diagnosis  They have all my medical records already.  Everybody knows I'm in pain and I need to be there.  I want to be able to go back to work but I don't want to fuck myself over by appearing to be a drug addict because I called in between appointments and asked if I could up my dose to the last script I had.  Do you think I could do it or should I just wait to go back and then tell him the dosage is too low and hope he ups it?  And should I have the exact count for the script in two weeks or should.i just take as many as I reasonably need and then tell him I'm low and need something else?  This is my first rodeo with pain management, I have no idea what the proper way to handle this is.  Any input would be appreciated.",0.0,0.606388,0.669275,0.0,0.545523,0.0,0.0,0.20398009950248755

We are 34 weeks, and so she is having a bit of trouble with heartburn and choking on her spit. I understand that this happens to lots of pregnant women...but I'll try to keep the story brief. I picked up a prescription for her tonight while getting my TDAP shot (yay!), then came home and cooked her dinner. I finished dinner and set the table and we sat down to eat. While eating dinner (delicious Blue Apron tacos), she started to get heartburn so she paused after her first taco and got some heartburn medicine; Healthy Mama Tame the Flame. She took a heartburn pill, then took a few minutes to stare at her food and not eat it. Then comes the fun part...She choked on her spit and started coughing while at the dinner table, then looked at me with the most adorable sheepish grin imaginable, and said to me, ""Uh oh"". This is not typically a phrase my wife says. She continued to look at me as she stood up so I asked if she was okay, and she then says, ""I just peed myself...""I couldn't help it. I started laughing. She laughed with me. We laughed and laughed as she walked away to go change. I pulled the cover off of both chairs because it was time for a bleaching anyways and threw them in the washer. Still laughing. She is such an amazing sport, and such an amazing woman, and we kept laughing together as she re-emerged from the bedroom in new pants. I admire her to no end, and all of the pregnant women on here.

Combines general swedish massage and deep tissue as needed. Also, I know you already have a chiropractor but the chiros there (I see Dr. Hansmeier) do active release technique for the muscles surrounding areas of trouble in addition to adjustments and it really helps. Also, adjustments are only going to accomplish so much unless you prevent whatever is causing the misalignments and pain to reoccur (bad posture, etc) so hopefully your chiro should be giving you exercises to do in addition to their adjustments.

s,"So I’m about 4 weeks post op from my hysterectomy. The struggle to get my surgery started years before with years of rough periods. But August 19th my world took an odd turn. My tummy was upset for 4 days prior and I couldn’t eat normally, I  kept getting full and I had gas like pain. Adding to it I was having my normal rough period with cramps, back pain, and just being miserable. I went to the dr and they admitted me due to pain and I went though 4 days in the hospital, CT scans, X-rays, colonoscopy, and endoscopy. They sent me home saying there was fluid in my abdomen from a ruptured cyst and I should be fine soon. I followed up with my PCP the next day and he put me on nausea meds and the BRAT diet to help me.  A week later we were in Dallas for the passing of my husband’s grandmother. I wasn’t eating still but at the reception I ate a cookie. 3 hours later I started vomiting and was in extreme pain. I guess luckily everything was over because I was stuck in the church restroom puking for an hour. My husband took me to an ER Clinic. They did a vaginal and normal ultrasound. They said a large cyst had ruptured and  I was sent home with stronger pain meds. That Friday I went to see a new OB, mine wasn’t available. After a rough start he did an examine and said a hysterectomy may be my best bet to help with the period pain. Another week later I still couldn’t eat without puking. I was down 15lbs in 3 weeks. I went to see a GI at this point. I got a PICC line put in the next day (a 30 min process that took 2.5 hours due to issues with my nerves) and TPN (nutrition) started the next day because I wasn’t going to make it though surgery at the rate I was going. From September 6th until the 18th I was on a TPN bag for 20 -16 hours a day with nothing other then water, popsicles, and applesauce. I was on opioids from the start of all of this so I was a zombie. Finally the surgery came and I was scared because we still hadn’t figured out the tummy issues but we had to get the hysterectomy done first and see if the dr saw anything internally. During the robotic laparoscopic surgery the dr found endometriosis, my ovaries were fused to my uterus and I had blood filled cysts all over. He got them ruptured, separated the ovaries, pulled out the cervix, fallopian tunes, and uterus. So I get out and the recovery starts but all my support group and I are thinking is “will I be able to eat?”  I leave the hospital on 12 hour TPN and am allowed to start introducing small amounts of food (soup, yogurt, etc). 3 1/2 weeks post op I’m moving around, eating, off pain meds, TPN has stopped, PICC line is out,  and I’m eating normally. So all that to say I should be jumping up and down and on a high because it’s October 13th and after 2 months my life is getting normal..... but I can’t. I’m tired, sad, frustrated, and just crying whenever I can get a minute alone. My family is worried about me because this isn’t me but I can’t get out of the funk. I’m faking it but not enjoying things. I’m still hurting internally and with the incisions but I wasn’t ready for the feelings that would come fromall this.My family says it will time and I’m getting better every day but I don’t feel it and I feel guilt for the additional worry I’m causing. I don’t know if the dr damaged my ovaries- which he said he could’ve done due to the fusion of them to my uterus. How does everyone else feel emotionally after their hysterectomy?

The pulsing went down my arms to my hands.While driving a laser sodomized me and the right side of my face.I looked again for the second lingerie bag packed with copper mesh that last month I had stored along with my WWII steel helmet in my storage unit.  I needed to test whether three strong magnets shielded brain zapping. The magnets were too large to put inside my helmet. Thus, I switched to a large vintage cast iron kettle. I removed the copper mesh.  The  magnets did help shield brain zapping but not remote neural monitoring. The last several nights, I have taken out the copper mesh from my australian outback hat to stuff in my kettle. In the morning, I put the copper mesh back inside my hat. Both the magnets and copper mesh fit inside the kettle. I did not need to store the copper mesh after all.  While doing laundry, a laser pulsed my back. Mind control to wear dirty clothes.Heavy pressure on the top of my mind. Lightheaded. Mentally and physically fatigued.

Not a recording of a human voice. Snoring is continuous. This hum lasted less than ten seconds. Interval was approximately 2 minutes but not exactly every two minutes. I remained still so I could listen to it. I was concerned if I moved the torturers would know I was awake and would stop this hum.In the background, was the typical hum which consisted of two hums. One medium high pitch and one medium pitch. These I hear the entire time I am awake. I usually don't hear them when I awaken but haven't moved yet. The hum starts when I move alerting the torturers that I am awake.The typical hum is ultrasound hearing. The typical hum feels internal. This new low pitch hum feels external. Like I am actually hearing it with my ears. Does technology exist that can create external sounds? Or is this low pitch hum V2K? While sleeping, I wear a copper lined cap inside a cast iron kettle. There is copper mesh inside a lingerie bag inside the kettle protecting my brain from remote neural monitoring. There are throw pillow covers packed with water bottles surrounding the kettle. The kettle covers my head part way to my ears. Can V2K be conducted by striking below the ears or at the lower ear?In the past several months, an external sound woke me up but I could not identify it and did not lay still waiting for the noise to reoccur.Why a third hum?  Is there subliminal messages modulated in this hum? All the hums?It was difficult staying still as I was being sodomized and a maser was burning my legs. My legs felt pinned down by pressure waves.

s,"Hi guys, so back in November 4, 2020 I hurt my lower back while pulling up a patient in bed who wouldn’t let go on the side rails while they were in Trendelenburg with my co-worker. By the end of the shift, I was really sore. I thought maybe it’d go away, but nope. I woke up in excruciating pain on the morning of November 5th. I still thought the pain would eventually go away so I decided not to report the work injury. But then November 10th came around and I was still in the same amount of pain. At this point, I knew I had to do something. So on November 14, 2020 I had my first chiropractor appointment. Three sessions in, I decided it was time to report my injury to work (due to the urging of my co-workers) and I’m now under workers compensation. Wednesday, December 23rd was my last chiropractor appointment. While the pain did subside for almost a day or two, the pain would just get worse or radiate to other areas (now it’s up higher in my mid back and it feels like there’s something bunched up under me when I lay down) after every adjustment. I felt as if the sciatica pain would just go away for a bit and then come back. Also, I was taken out of work for a week, but because I had several things I had to pay for I begged to come back to work (hospital) and I didn’t want to live off of a $300 check that workers comp would send weekly as that wouldn’t be enough in comparison to when I actually worked. In addition, I found out on my MRI that I had a small protrusion from L3-L4 that’s mildly flattening the thecal sac and a mild bulging disc from L4-L5. I’m only 25. I’m scared this’ll never go away and I’ll be in pain for the rest of my life. Is there any words of advice or reassurance? I’m also going to start physical therapy after I have a consultation with a rehab doctor next week. I really hope I heal and bounce back soon. I’m not sure if these are contributing factors, but I’m 5’4”, 170 lbs, work in a job that involves pulling and lifting patients, and I don’t exercise too often outside of work and I sit a lot when I’m home.

c,"I've dealt with migraines since I was 11. Around 14 they started getting more frequent. Around age 22 they became at least once a month lasting for 2-4 days and shorter but equally painful migraines in between, and keep in mind my migraines are always accompanied by excessive eye tearing, nose running, urgent severe diarrhea and nausea/bloating. By 28 they were every single month, usually twice a month, and in concert with my ovulation and period. 2-5 days during ovulation, 2-5 days during period. Then around 29-30 I developed interstitial cystitis, which feels like stabbing, muscle spasms and a UTI in your bladder all at the same time 24/7, and I peed every 45 minutes. Between working full time, migraines and that and especially young children who were perfect height for hugging and squeezing me full force right at the abdomen level, it was Absolute hell. Then this last year I was in a car accident, I was rear ended at 55mph while my car was stopped. The last 11mo have been physical therapy, speech therapy, balance therapy, hip surgery, back pain, migraines went from the crappy but predictable 2 extended per mo, to almost daily. Post concussive syndrome meant I have memory issues, insomnia, can't think in busy areas, visual issues that make it hard to drive it night or be in bright light still. I developed POTS, small fiber neuropathy, and an autoimmune disease all within the first 4mo after the accident. I have permanent damage to my vestibular and visual systems. However... I also have children. A family that relies on me. And I didn't really have a choice but to work, as far as I saw it. I had a lot of gritted teeth, a lot of early bedtimes or sneaking away to the bedroom for a few hours just to try to deal with it all. If I had taken off work every time I had a migraine or excruciating bladder pain, or felt fuzzy, or was dizzy, I would have always lost my job. I just didn't consider it an option, so I went anyway - probably very often when I shouldn't have. I just didn't know any other way, and I knew I needed insurance to get the care I needed to help with these issues (although migraine meds were never adequate). But because I knew even before this car accident which seems to be the icing on the cake, that I was going to have to find a way to make life work for me, I set my sights and did it. I went from working in regular office 8-5 jobs to working in small business home offices. I juggled two jobs, one 9-3 and the other 6-8, to cobble together full time work in smaller and low key environments that also allowed me a break in the middle to check in with family and recoup. Then I found a job entirely from home. I've worked from home since 2014. If I didn't have a virtual job I absolutely would have been on disability these last 10mo. This job and not having coworkers down my throat allows me to step away and rest when needed, go to the non-stop therapies and appointments (at my peak I had 6 therapy sessions per week between balance, speech and PT) and no less than 1 regular doctor visit per week. The therapies were all local but the doctors are all a 1hr drive each way. Compare this to a family member of mine who was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease at age 18. He immediately gave up on college, went full bore into smoking/drinking/partying (all things that exacerbate this GI disease), and did literally everything opposite of what could help him be healthy. He's now mid-30s, on SSDI because he never held a job, and chronically malnourished, chronically depressed, and chronically ill. He hasn't had a girlfriend in 7 years, and that one was only brief because she had a hospital fetish. Before that it had been 7 years since the last girlfriend too. What is the difference? I decided that having shit problems just meant I had to work harder to have the same success, but that also meant I'd enjoy the success more. When I learned I had IC, I looked into every option I could to control symptoms through diet and lifestyle. With migraines I dealt with the shitty subpar doctor's care and half-ass scripts until this year, I'll admit I let that constant pain slide for way too long. When I got the POTS label, I ordered a pulse ox immediately, found the CHOP Dallas Protocol and work it like a boss, got my salt/water intake down to a science, used my pulseox for biofeedback, etc. For the autoimmune I changed my diet as needed to minimize inflammation, take my meds like my life depends on it (it kind of does if you think about it), added turmeric curcumin and fish oil every single day. Basically, at every juncture, I decided I'd do whatever it took to set up my life in a way that I can live and take the most advantage of it. And I just did it.

c,"As mentioned by other people in this thread, the variety of the work will be much greater with PT. You can work at outpatient clinics, hospitals, home care, etc. In my experience a chiropractor usually owns a business or work at an outpatient PT clinic (simply because no PTs at that specific clinic are that good at manipulations so they hire a chiro for that). With PT, your patients will vary greatly and you can work with kids as well as elderly people.  With chiro you will manipulate spines. Period. Sure you'll get the occasional shoulder, elbow, whatever but the lower back pain patients will still fill most of your day. Sure, LBP is an extremely common patient for PTs too, but not nearly to the same extent. Also, the patients seeking chiro are often the ones who think there's a quick fix to everything which can be frustrating.. Also, since you live in Canada and I in Sweden, PT is cheap and after a while free for the patient, which means we will try to help the patient as fast as we can and get them to be able to handle their problem themselves and not have to come back more than a few times. We do not win anything by taking the patient back an extra session. Chiros on the other hand might choose to take the patient back because they make a lot of money on them. And since it's a 100 % passive treatment, the patient has to rely completely on the chiro and will never be able to handle and treat their pain on their own which means they have to come back over and over again. This is not something you wish for as a PT - if your patient has to come back 2 months after your treatment, you didn't choose the right one. I'm generally negative towards chiropractors and for that I am sorry - there are great ones, I know. But the amount of unserious ones I've met through my work is absolutely ridiculous and unfortunately that makes me doubt their whole profession. I've had so many patients that have had pain along the spine, went to a chiro that didn't examine properly (and just went with the usual ""oh, your pelvis is tilted""), and then came to me with a terrible hernia as a result.

s,"I am a 19 year old girl. I was in a car accident 4 months ago. I split open my forehead, broke my nose and several ribs, and sustained injury to my back (herniated disc). I have become severely depressed as a result. I now have a huge ugly keloid scar right in the middle of my forehead and a crooked nose. I am also suffering from hearing loss due to the result of a head injury and constant ongoing back pain. I took my good hearing and health for granted till it was gone. I used to play lacrosse at University and had to quit due to the chronic back pain and my depression. The pain is the worst when I stand up or try to run. I can't even leave the house anymore. I feel like everyone is looking at me and judging me and staring at my scar. All I do is sit at home and scream and cry. I don't know why I scream exactly, but I can't seem to help it. I hate feeling so helpless. I hate making my family so worried and upset. I keep replaying the day the accident happened (I was driving) and wishing that I never got in the car that day. If I hadn't been rushing and running late this never would have happened and I wouldn't know this pain. I am seeing a therapist 4 times a week and am taking prozac for my depression. I am only 19 and can't even fathom the thought of living the rest of my life like this. With a huge scar on my forehead, constant back pain, a crooked nose, and having to ask people to repeat things multiple times because I can't hear properly. I feel so hopeless because I've been told that my back pain will be a life-long problem and so will the scar and other problems. I dropped out of college and am living at home with my parents because I can't focus on anything anymore. All I do is sit and cry all day long and I hate being a burden to my family. I hate making them stressed out worrying about me. It's not fair to them. All I do is make everyone miserable. I find no joy in anything anymore. I just want to die. I'm worthless in this life and can't imagine holding a job in the future. I honestly would rather die then live the rest of my life like this. This is no way to live. Feeling like a sad, hopeless, ugly burden to everyone is horrible. I never considered suicide before, but it really seems like my only option at this point. I know that I will never accept what has happened. I will never be able to play sports again, never talk to a friend freely on the other side of the room, never feel pretty again. I used to be so independent and self-assured and now I find myself really NEEDING people all the time.

s,"Hello. This is a bit long so bear with me. I started a lifting regimen in Jan including squats. Shorty after, started having upper back pain. Doctor said it was fine and to maybe lighten up the weight. Instead I just switched to leg press. Well the other day I read about GOMAD (I'm a skinny guy) and good beginner programs so I decided to get serious and try to fix my squats. My back was hurting Monday when doing 3x5 @ 205. Read about using a close grip, and my arms had been out pretty wide. So I did that and sort of flexed my shoulder blades while doing them and my back felt pretty good. So, my question is twofold. First, what is the truth about arm width and is upper back pain common on squats? And also, when my arms were in closer (and my elbows more down) I felt like I could put a bit of the bar weight in my arms to alleviate my back - is this normal? I'm not *sure* this is what I did; I only thought about it after the fact. At the time I just did it without thinking about it. Sorry if this doesn't make any sense!

s,"Hey all!  Surgery went well and I think they're letting us out tomorrow.  In the meantime I'm averaging about 4 hours of sleep/day and I don't even care - I'm just so happy to be done being pregnant and to have the sweetest little baby ever.Backstory in a nutshell:  C/S scheduled for the 23rd of July (39w0d) as it was to be my 3rd one.  I had a bit of a rough pregnancy with SPD, anemia, borderline GD, serious GI issues, all while wrangling a 2yo boy in the meantime.  Fortunately I have good people in my life or I might not have survived. Here's how it went down (condensed version - wrote it a couple times now but keep finding I've included too much detail - this is after several trims and it's still long - enjoy!)Friday night: agitated, restless. No pain really and no contractions but still found it impossible to get comfortable. Rough night. Woke up really cranky Sat morning.Saturday morning: Preparing to welcome MIL who has been planning for months to visit and help with the 1-to-2 baby transition, and who by some stroke of inexplicable foresight didn't change her flights even after finding out my surgery wasn't scheduled until 12 days into a 30 day trip.We picked her up at about noon and decided lunch must be next. The group asked *me* where I wanted to go, and I suggested Red Robin. I was feeling weirdly appalled at myself for that choice and yet I felt insistent that this is where we had to go.I sampled a few delicious if ill-advised American cuisine items. Afterwards I was feeling quite ill and uncomfortable (but not really in pain still and no contractions or clear idea what was wrong). I resolved the situation as well as possible in a bathroom stall by pacing, breathing funny, and trying to get pressure off my spine (and TMI finally managing to purge out my guts which did very little to relieve the feelings of pressure and discomfort). I returned to my family and asked husband to please take me to L&amp;D. He did the 30m trip in probably record time and i was too delirious to care that he was passing everyone else on the interstate - which for me is saying something, I'm usually such a PITA backseat driver. Meanwhile I still had no contrax and no idea what I was going to tell L&amp;D when I got there.The rest is just sort of history. They gave me a room and I laid down on my side and found instant if incomplete relief. The chest/back pain morphed slowly into contractions which got closer together and the doc found I'd dilated a little bit from the last check I'd gotten at a routine appt a few days prior. After a trip home to get some walking done and packing just in case, they observed me for about another hour and then recommended I go ahead with my C/S officially around 9:30. Another hour later the procedure was underway, and Ms. Ada Cynthia Raphaëlle appeared shortly after that.The surgery was as unbelievably positive as any major surgery could ever hope to be. No one took my baby away from me again once they finally gave her to me, and before I was even able to regain feeling in my legs she had latched and begun nursing like a champ.  48 hours later my milk supply is already fully established and her weight loss is under 3% (with 10% being allowable/expected). As the recipient of 3 C/S surgeries, the first two of which were each traumatic in their own ways, I am so relieved and grateful to have finally had a good experience with the act of bringing a child into the world. It is clear in retrospect that there had been something really BIG missing from both of my prior deliveries and it seems at long last it has been corrected. (I'd always suspected it to be so, but now I fully understand what ""it"" is, even as I can't really articulate it).And how about the timing? Ada's middle name was my responsibility and I had long ago chosen ""Raphaëlle"" for it's euphony, but it had been weighing on my mind that it would be nice to include ""Cynthia"" (my MIL's name - long story there) somehow - I just hadn't decided for sure if we were going to do it or how. The synchronicity of their respective arrivals with Ada deciding to make her appearance mere hours after her grandma arrived in town, however, was the sign I needed, and now Ada has two middle names.The events over the past 48 hours have been so surreal - I keep expecting to wake up pregnant and miserable having been trolled by the most incredibly lucid dream I've ever had, but here I am with a baby in my arms and the dream is still going...What a... thing... life is sometimes, you know? (sorry, &lt;8 total hours of sleep over the past 48+ hours means I'm not braining well anymore.

s,"&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Every year, doctors around the world receive patients who suffer from back pain. The pain affects areas of the back and also causes pain in surrounding areas, such as arms, legs, hand, and feet. The following article will give you tips to prevent back pain and avoid a doctor visit.&amp;#x200B;Put a towel behind your back. Your back pain might be caused, or at least exacerbated, by poor posture. If you find that you are sitting for long periods of time, try rolling up a towel. Place this behind the small of your back while you are sitting. It can improve posture and alleviate back pain.&amp;#x200B;Back pains try replacing your shoes. If your shoes are worn out, too big or too small, have no padding or arch support that could be your problem. Footwear affects your spinal placement causing you to have back pain. Replacing your old footwear could save you from having back pain.&amp;#x200B;Quit smoking. Among all of its other health risks, smoking can reduce the blood supply to the vertebrae that make up your spine. This loss of blood flow results in degeneration of the disks, making them more susceptible to injury and damage. This sort of disk damage doesn't cause passing back pain but permanent injury.&amp;#x200B;Men that suffer with back pain, should discontinue carrying a wallet in their hip pocket. Try putting the wallet in a front pocket instead, or at least remove it from your back pocket when sitting for long periods of time. A wallet, especially a thick one, can cause a lot of back pain. It can throw the hips out of alignment also.&amp;#x200B;Stretches and flexibility exercises can go a long way in preventing and even getting rid of back pain. If these stretches are done properly and according to guided direction you will see the results. Yoga is a good idea for certain situations, and especially for preventative measures. Talk to your doctor, and do all that you can for prevention of back pain.&amp;#x200B;Research has stated that around two-thirds of the population will develop some type of back pain. Most people think of back pain as the result of a traumatic injury of some kind. Often, an injury is just the culmination of a number of factors that have contributed to your back pain.&amp;#x200B;If you have to be in the sitting position for a large portion of your day, be sure that your chair has a comfortable pad in the back. This will help give your back the support that it needs, which in turn, will help to prevent any unnecessary back pains.&amp;#x200B;Many people know that exercise and proper posture can help relieve their back pain, but did you know that sometimes all you actually need to do is to de-stress? You may think your back pain is causing your stress, but actually it might be your stress causing your pain.&amp;#x200B;In conclusion, doctors worldwide receive patients suffering from back pain every year.

s,"Especially if, like me, your symptoms worsened after a significant health event (severe illness, pregnancy, surgery, etc). After a life of only mild symptoms, my c-section seemed to trigger severely debilitating symptoms. For three months I had adhesions, abdominal pain, extreme fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, nerve pain and numbness, and back pain and numbness. The adhesions and severe pain were treated via scar release therapy at four months postpartum, but my other symptoms have endured now for over a year. I thought I was just broken, or that it was just the natural progression of hEDS for someone my age (34). But no. Maybe not. I’ve discovered that breathing dysfunction (from a weak diaphragm/core) and SIBO (small intestine bacterial overgrowth) are likely to blame. Physical therapy, belly breathing, daily walks, and mild yoga have helped the breathing dysfunction (although I got covid in January, undid all of my progress, and had to start over). And although I still need to undergo treatment, I’ve already seen a reduction of symptoms of SIBO by switching to a low FODMAP diet. Now I have real hope I may get “better.” Both issues can happen as a result of major abdominal surgery. SIBO is more commonly triggered by food poisoning, or sometimes antibiotics or even certain probiotics. It can also be the result of reduced stomach acid with age, stress, etc. Anyway, my point is that there are comorbid conditions that people with connective tissue disorders are at risk for, or that we are more likely to suffer from more serious side effects than the general population. My theory is that the inflammation caused by these conditions is harder on us because we have weak nerves/joints. Treat the underlying condition, and it’s possible your symptoms may improve. Of course, this doesn’t apply to everyone. It’s also difficult to diagnose many problems, especially if your doctor isn’t helpful (mine just said it was anxiety or “normal” hEDS symptoms). But maybe my story can help some of you. I know it’s easy to just assume everything that’s wrong is just inevitable as a result of EDS, but I’m a lesson in how important it is not to do that. ❤️",0.530696,0.639199,0.908474,0.76241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26301369863013696
c,"No.  I have one of these: http://www.workriteergo.com/products/workcenters/premium.asp Regular exercise is even more important, though. Back pain from sitting is usually caused by constantly stretching your backside muscles (the posterior chain), which means you are constantly contracting your frontside muscles (the anterior chain).  This makes the posterior chain long and weak, and the anterior chain short and strong (in comparison).  The classic symptom of this is a hunched over posture. If you do sit all day, and you do get back pain, you should first start exercising more often, before you go and replace your chair.  And regardless of how good a chair you have, you can always sit in it with bad posture. Google is full of lots of resources to help you improve your posture.

Mom is 65, has never touched marijuana, and experiences intermittent and extremely painful/intense back pain. Three or four times a week, for hours at a time, she will get back pain so severe that every step is taken in obvious agony, but she powers through it because she's ""got shit to do"" (direct quote). It kills me to see her go through that. I'm back home right now (I live in a different city, but in-province) and it's clearly worse than it's ever been.  I told her 5 years ago that I was a weed smoker. We haven't said a single word about it since then. Marijuana has just never came up once. It's not a point of contention or anything, more like ""don't ask, don't tell"". It just hasn't needed to come up. But today I saw how much pain she was in and I asked her about what she's doing to get help, i.e. meds or therapy or whatever. She said she's taking psysio/chiro but they can't pinpoint a fix/cure, and she hasn't wanted to take hard meds because she's so worried of becoming dependent on something opiate-related as we have multiple family members who have gone through addiction issues and she's heard all the horror stories. I asked her if she had ever considered weed edibles and she said, ""No... it's never occurred to me. I don't even know how I'd go about getting something like that anyways and I can't really believe it'd work for me"".  That initiated a long, extensive discussion about my history with weed and going from smoking to vaping to vaping &amp; eating edibles, along with the general history of weed and it's benefits/uses (including with the negatives, as well). She was inquisitive and asked many, many questions along the way. By the end of it, she was open to the idea of trying edibles sometime if I really thought it would help, because she was becoming desperate. I, very happily, informed her that I brought three bags of gummies home with me that I had purchased from a reputable online store I had used multiple times in the past (supplies for upcoming boxing day and new years). She agreed to try one candy gummy (12.5mg THC, 4mg CBD) within the next hour, after she's (almost) done all her pre-Christmas cooking and shit.

And then stayed awake somewhere around 330 because i couldn't get comfortable.Then it was downhill from there. Started feeling sooooo tired. Was so tired I couldn't even take a nap. Went with hubby to his dr appt and out to lunch on our weekly date. Then picked up a few groceries and back home to rest before work. Usually hubs and I have sexy time like 2x by now. But I hadnt even really felt horny. So go to work .. I MARRIED THE BEST MAN EVER!! While at work he did laundry, dishes, scrubbed the bathtub, made dinner, ect.. ! !! Came home to everything being ready.  Crawl in bed because of the horrible back pain.  Still not feeling up for sexy time so we go to sleep.  Wake up who even knows how much to pee and am just awake at 330.... ugh. Cant breathe because of sinuses.  Cant get comfortable.  Finally get back to sleep just in time to wake up and get kids ready for school. After breakfast im finally able to breathe good without sinus trouble and sexy time sounds good. Besides for my hip feeling like it w a s going to pop outta place (thanks extra hormones) it was fantastic.   We are talking afterwards and hubby says he never thought he  would see the day I wasnt begging for it. And if all the pregnancy stuff has me outta the mood to just telll him. He understands and would rather me rest.

c,"I did try to become a caregiver through the program for my husband. My husband has PTSD, suffers from suicidal ideation, and also has facet joint arthritis in his back. The interview lasted an hour, it was just a lot of answering questions about what's wrong with my husband and how I help him day to day. I also explained how I had to quit my job to stay at home to help my husband, whether it be to make sure he didn't harm himself, didn't have a horrible panic attack when I wasn't home to help him through it, or to help him get out of bed and get dressed (which is sometimes hard for him with his back pain). I went into a lot more detail about his mental state and the nonstop nightmares he experiences. At the end of the interview, she told me that since my husband doesn't have any serious physical limitations like being wheelchair bound, she didn't think it would get approved. I got a call a month later from her and she told me that it wasn't approved but I could do something called Building Better Caregivers, which is basically just a support group that helps caregivers learn and cope.

c,"Most often we start by mistaking back pain.  When we lift poorly, the pressure is not transferred directly and equally on one or more of our discs in the back. This can lead to damage of the disc which by itself is not extremely painful. The problem is that the disc and skeletal structures when put under stresses it is not meant to handle, can push on soft tissues such as nerves. Pinch a nerve too long, and it dies, along with its functions. The nerves in our back leave through holes in our spine at the varying levels, and these varying level nerves are responsible for certain and specific functions. Kill the nerve and lose the function. Most of the pain comes from the nerves signaling that they are or have been hurt. The pain can radiate from the disc, all the way down to your knees and feet. It's hard to tell the cause bc the radiating pain is so severely misleading. The nerves can cause related muscles to completely seize up, causing extreme muscle pain as well as the horrendous nerve pain.  To help yourself at home, look for videos online that talk about McKenzie exercises. These exercises are meant to help you relax and realign issues with your back. If it is pain caused by nerve injury, expect healing to take months. A nerve grows at a rate that is so slow. My last bout took 6 months to get close to normal. To diagnose the cause, go see a good physiotherapist and tell them you need to diagnose the cause, to learn how to prevent it in the future. This may involve first xray to look at the skeleton, and then, as was my case, MRI to diagnose injured discs. Disc injury is forever. Your body has an immune response to get used to the injury enough to allow every day motions, but you need to watch it for life now. Walking was the best thing for me. Walk a few times a day for a few kms. Best of luck, and maybe look at the sciatica and piriformis syndrome subs too. Dont forget. Disc injury is for life.

One day a few hours after I'd come home from school, my mom starts puking and shitting her guys out nonstop. She thought it was withdrawal from back pain medicine. She heads to the bathroom, and falls and can't get up. Literally cannot get up. Her fiancé calls an ambulance and I'm crying in my room because I don't know what the fuck to do. She gets to the hospital and apparently the ulcer was the cause of her losing weight/puking/cramping all the time, and she had lost half of her blood due to internal bleeding.

She gets headaches a few times a week and had been taking those pills for over 20 years.  TL;DR: Mom thought her puking was from pill withdrawal, turned out to be stomach ulcers and almost died.

s,"I lost my mother last July 28, so coming up close to the 1-year mark. I'm finally just getting past the denial stage. It was all so unexpected.    My mother (56) lived a very unhealthy lifestyle, physically and emotionally. She had terrible chronic back pain and she abused painkillers quite heavily for at least a decade, but stopped a couple years before her death. She lost a lot of weight and was no longer obese. And, when her mother died in November of 2014, she finally had the money to leave an awful awful home situation and start fresh (at my urging and encouragement). I helped her co-sign a lease. I flew across the country to help her move. I bought her some new things for her place. I was SO, SO, SO unbelievably proud of her. She was finally making changes to take care of herself and she was heading in the right direction.    But, the years of poor emotional health were barely beginning to heal, and she was still suffering a lot. Especially with the death of her mother, she started drinking quite a bit. She knew it was a problem. She even checked herself into the hospital to detox and get sober.     She died 3 weeks later.    She had multiple organ failure, but the primary cause was cirrhosis and possibly pancreatic cancer.    Still, a year later, my heart just feels absolutely ripped apart by this -- her deep emotional suffering, the attempts to finally get better, and the unfairness of dying so unexpectedly even though she was making changes.    What if she hadn't drank those final few months? Would her liver have failed her? Would she still be here, and finally happy? Does she know how proud I was of her for trying to turn her life around? Was she scared when the process of death began? Did she feel like she wasted her life through allowing herself to suffer through much of it? Did she feel alone? Was she caught just as off-guard by it as we all were?    I know these are all unanswerable questions, and ultimately meaningless - what is is.

c,"I used to struggle with this a lot more before I had almost a year of sobriety under my belt, but one thing that helped me is developing daily routines of both self-care and self-cultivation and really sticking to them. I used to skip brushing my teeth and showering a few times a week because I was just so depressed I did not care for example (that would fall under self care). In terms of self-cultivation, I've been doing a lot of reading, studying, and practicing of things like mindfulness, meditation, and working out daily to try to get out of being out of shape and that's helped me develop a healthier mentality, mindset, and build up a bit of emotional strength/resilience so when bad/unwanted things happen it's less devastating and the recovery time is a lot lower. It used to be that one crap thing happening would derail my whole day and many/most of the days during my week would be derailed; nowadays bad things can happen and I manage to maintain a positive, can-do attitude. Maybe you should find some healthy hobbies or develop interests that make you feel good/rewarded/whole and make it a habit of doing them every day or as often as you can?

c,"Not too bad. I quit lifting altogether about 2 years ago because I kept having issues, and started doing Muay Thai kickboxing to stay in shape. Conditioning went through the roof, but I had to quit that after a year due to inflammation in my feet. Damn body LOL. After I recovered from that, I am back to lifting, but very, very carefully. I have a list of every lift that causes me issues, and I just don't do them anymore. I miss squats, but clean and jerk, power clean, and a few random others that irritate my back I am fine without.  Deadlifts are on the potential cutting board, but I think staying in a lighter weight range may allow me to keep them in my arsenal. I've had problems twice now when getting close to 300, but low to mid 2's have been fine. At first it was depressing pulling 4 plates when I used to pull 10 and change, but being healthier and not walking around in pain really helps counter that.  I started working in higher rep ranges, aiming for 10 on most lifts, so that I'm rarely lifting riskier amount of weight. It took a bit to get out of the mindset of powerlifting, but I realized I'm not ever going to complete, and being about to walk around on the weekend with my wife pain free is more important than my numbers. I don't push through pain anymore, outside of muscle soreness or fatigue, if something hurts while lifting, I'm done with that lift for the day. If it's low back pain on back and biceps day, I switch to biceps and upper back and then head home for some ice.

c,"Yeah exactly that, glutamate excess to be specific. But as i said if i for instance take a high dosage of an nmda receptor antagonist at once it can cause the opposite, a lack of glutamate which then starts to cause light schizophrenic like symptoms. I had to raise my doage to the point that i reached an optimal balance, and yes that dosage is much higher than what's used for alzheimers.  And the excitotoxicity is my main issue, you got it right. I don't exactly know what causes the glutamate excess, it can be overactivity of the receptors but also overactivity or underactivity of enzymes and transporters, can also be a bit of all together. Either way memantine and ketamine work great to correct it. I would love to figure out what the source is but with nowadays technology it's not yet possible to narrow down.  Atm i am taking 100mg memantine a day (the original, generics can be much weaker and require higher dosages). This dosage ensures that my glutamate release is suppressed enough that i don't get any negative symptoms. I am also so sensitive to it that if i miss a dosage i notice the effect after a few hours. The excitotoxicity at first usually presents like a migraine that's getting worse, the more glutamate is accumulating the more symptoms pop up and the more severe it gets. So first migraine like, then back pain, then muscle spasms in my back and tension all over, psychological symptoms such as irritability and emotions fluctuating present more and more, then urethral spasms, then the migraine worsens into more severe brain fog and i also get nystagmus, maybe even focal seizures (lots of zoning out the more severe it gets), memory loss, balance issues etc, then pain starts to become more intense, glutamate intensifies pain perception, depression and suicidiality start and intensify more and more. After a few days off the meds my nervous system, hormonal system, digestion, temperature regulation and much more starts going havoc more and more. It's like getting sicker and sicker with the weirdest... Neurological flu ever. It's also really crazy how suddenly and fast all symptoms improve again when i start taking my meds again.

s,"Love this community and keto has been amazing for me. I started with a New Years resolution to lose weight this year and while there is still two months left my progress has been wonderful so far. I am down 4 shirt sizes, 5 pant sizes, and my wedding ring has went from 12.5 to 9.5!! Total weight lost is 117.4 lbs!After 2 weeks of keto my wedding ring started falling off. This was really telling to how much inflammation I had in my body from eating a carb heavy diet. I had joint pain and back pain and you name it and it probably hurt. It is nearly non existent now. I have tried to stick to under 35 net carbs a day and have nearly the entire time. I did go off keto 2 separate times and both times regretted it. I would not recommend ""treating yo' self"" with old food you thought made you happy because it will make you feel terrible! If you are just starting it does get EASY! Keto is second nature now for me and not really something I have to think through. It is just how I eat now...  Not a struggle at all. It took time to get there though! I have tracked everyday in myfitnesspal. My streak was broken along the way because I missed a day in the beginning but worst things have happened. Add me: dfauldsIf you have not found these they are a secret weapon in my keto arsenal. Mama Lupe's low carb wraps. Holy crap they are tasty and you can use them for wraps or bake those puppies for chips or make thin crust pizza. Only 4 net carbs per wrap!!!!  Another thing I do quite often is microwave yellow American cheese. Buy it from the deli. Take it home and break each piece into 4 or 8 squares. Line your microwave spinny plate thingy with parchment paper.  Put those small squares of cheese around the outside edge and zap them for 45 seconds or until they start to brown on top. Pull them out and BOOM homemade cheeze its.  Dip them, crumble them in some keto friendly soup, crunch them over salad, or just eat them plain.  I bring these bad boys with me all the time when I am going to watch football or to a non keto friendly party that I know will activate my snack beast. Other cheeses will work but don't have the right consistency.I found both those things on this forum but maybe you missed the post! Quick edit: I was a binge eater before keto. It was nothing for me to eat two super sized value meals and the Golden Arches or an entire large pizza with a 2 liter of coke before I started this. Keto has allowed me to break my binge eating completely. Food used to rule my life. I was scheming of how to get more junk food constantly. Planning the next meal while I was gorging on the current one. Eating in secret because I was embarrassed. I don't even think about food until I am hungry and require it now. Admittedly I eat a lot of the same stuff now but it is because I eat for energy and not pleasure and it makes it simple.

c,I'm not a kinesiology expert but just thinking through your description the psoas may be recruited while the client is actively raising his legs.  Since the lumbar vertebrae are already shifted anteriorly and likely unstable the pull of the psoas on them may cause the bilateral sciatic symptoms it elicits.  It seems that the results of the CT would suggest his sciatica is due to nerve entrapment at the lumbar spine and massage is unlikely to resolve it.  However you can work on muscles affected by the neuropathy as well as focus on the hamstrings and paraspinals to reduce spasm due to the anteriolisthesis.

These will help you strengthen your deep core intrinsic stabilizers which will help alleviate some back pain. You can even do a hanging pelvic tilt. Also, supermans and both reverse hypers and hyperextensions will help. And planks are great as long as you make sure to brace with your abs and don't let the movement go into your low back. Think about doing the pelvic tilt as you hold the plank.

Though, it's also trailing a stringent set of rules. The moves are very old and primitive and presented the same way by everybody. This consistency looks wonderful on the stage, but some performers want more freedom than ballet provides.

s,"I’ve had IBS for as long as I can remember to varying levels of severity throughout my life and I used to swing pretty heavily between constipation and diarrhea. These days I seem to lean more towards constipation however over the past year or so as my IBS has seemingly worsened with age, I’ve started experiencing something new and progressively more frequently that I can only describe as “constipated diarrhea”. What I mean is that I can what I would consider constipated, smaller hard movement every 4/5 or more days for a few weeks (my normal  has always been a “normal” BM every 2-3 days with little to no cramping) until one day my insides decide to put a rush order on things at which point I proceed to go through a sometimes multi hour severe cramping session where I can see (I’m quite thin) and feel everything slowly moving through my intestines. After much time and pain I finally have the urge to evacuate but it’s initially those smaller hard to pass stools with lots of very bad cramping, but eventually the “plug” so to speak, gets released and is followed up by a generous amount of soft serve, pretty foul smelling loose stool/watery diarrhea.It can be horribly painful at times and often leaves me writhing around in pain on the toilet until I get a release. In fact, I’m writing this right now in the wake of an episode where I also experienced something new... I awoke this morning after only a few hours sleep to a sort of radiant pain throughout my mid to lower back and abdomen as well as the normal bad cramping.

s,"Hey doctors, so I'm a 27-year-old woman, no kids, white, 120-125 pound woman, recently moved to a new city and have a new doctor, and I'm in a bit of a pickle.   For about 3 weeks now, I've been having pretty bad upper right quadrant pain, right shoulder pain, right-sided neck pain, middle of back pain and right-sided back pain, especially at night, and especially after fatty things like butter and pesto. Sometimes it goes away mostly, leaving a tender spot under my ribs and only about a 1-2, but sometimes it's there in full force, like a 6+ out of 10. I am also nauseated sometimes, though I have not vomited. It hurts a little to push around, but nothing horrendous. No real changes to my bowel movements, besides a bit constipated/rabbit poops from eating less. I have also lost my appetite almost completely- it's not until I'm dizzy and have other signs of lack of food that I realize I haven't eaten enough.  I went to urgent care following eating a medium Frosty from Wendy's the night before, because I was in a lot of pain- about a 6. The urgent care doctor said it sounded like a gallbladder issue and gave me the option of either going to the ER or going home and talking to my PCP. I chose the ER option because I was extremely nauseated. This doctor called the ER and told them that I was coming in for an ultrasound, then told me that they were prepped to give me an ultrasound.   When I got there though, they gave me an IV, checked kidney function, and started the process for a CT scan. I went through with the CT scan along with blood work. The CT scan was clear, and my blood work was perfect, so they released me telling me to follow up with my PCP in 3-5 days.  Today was the first day my PCP could see me, about 2 weeks after the ER visit. I took my paperwork with me, because this was a different health network and they did not have access to my results. My paperwork did not include CT results, only bloodwork. I talked to him about the process, and I told him that the CT scan was clear. He said that it does sound an awful lot like gallbladder issues, but based on blood work and the CT scan being clear he couldn't make that call. So instead, he gave me a referral for a dietitian to help me find out if I have any food intolerances. He told me to start a food journal- though I already had, 2 weeks ago. He did not ask to see it or go through it with me and instead said that the dietitian would do so. I did have blood work drawn at my checkup, though I have not heard the results.   But on to the second part of my question- how do I show a doctor research?  I have a science degree myself- but environmental/ecology, not medical. But I'm ever curious so I dug into research about gallstones. Many sources said that CT scans actually miss gallstones, and that ultrasounds should be used as first-line for diagnosis. And then I came across this paper that has this bit in it.  &gt; A CT scan, when performed, is only of use if it shows the presence of calculi, but if it does not show any, they still cannot be excluded: even though the detection of calculi by CT can be optimised by non-injected slices being analysed by carefully adjusting windowing for optimal contrast, 20% of calculi are missed (too close in density to the bile and too small) \[4\]. A CT scan is therefore less effective than ultrasound for detecting vesicular calculi and less effective than MRCP for those in the common bile duct (CBD) (Fig. 6).     &gt;  &gt;Clinicians are not always aware of the poor negative predictive value of CT for biliary calculi. It may therefore be useful to make this explicitly clear in the radiological report by noting: ‘‘absence of calculi that are sufficiently dense to be visible on the CT scan’’.   [https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211568413000934](https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211568413000934)  So should I call the doctor back and ask for an ultrasound and send this paper? Should I go through with the dietitian stuff? See another doctor? Ask for a gastroenterologist instead?  I'm in the US, so I'm a bit limited by insurance... I also don't want to tell doctors how to do their job, but I really want to feel better before summer so I can get involved with some ecology research in my new area.

s,"Hi all, I know this is not the place to go to for a diagnosis and a doctor can only do that, but we don't want to get a second opinion right now and go to any medical facilities due to corona. I would appreciate any thoughts on this situation!For the past 1.5 months, my mom (54, no family history of ALS) has had weakness on her left side (leg and hand), foot drop, some clumsiness, tightness in left calf (she said it used to feel heavy like wood 1 month ago but now is better but still tight), lost motor functions in left hand (cant zipper jacket, cant cut nails with left hand), muscle twitching, lost appetite, lost 8 lbs, a frozen shoulder (she's had shoulder problems for a while so not sure if this is separate problem or related to ALS), and shortness of breath. The weakness has stayed consistent (not really worsened). Her shortness of breath is sometimes really bad and she can't even talk &amp; has to just focus on breathing, &amp; sometimes its manageable. Her EMG 1 month back said ""evidence of active denervation in L5-S1 innervated muscle distally on the left, with motor axonal loss in the left peroneal/LF &amp; tibial/S1 distribution. No sensory abnormalities or denervation in the lumbosacral paraspinal region. Prominent demyelinating features not seen. Findings suggested localization around left L5-S1 nerve roots i.e radiculopathy. However, clinically patient also has left upper extremity weakness &amp; did not have neck/back pain. An acquired inflammatory/autoimmune polyneuropathy suspected."" All other tests came back mostly normal, &amp; she always has had low B12/vitamin D (we're vegetarian) &amp; is anemic. Her doctor told her it is probably CIPD and then later change it to GBS. She had 5 days of an IVIG a month ago (she couldn't handle the side effects so it was a 3 day treatment, then a 2 day break, then another 2 day treatment), which didn't seem to help. She has no trouble swallowing &amp; no slurred speech. One interesting thing to note is before this all started, she had a pill of viviscal, 1 day later developed what she thinks is gout in her right toe, took meds for this, and 4 days later woke up with the gout in her right toe gone but extreme tightness (wood-like feeling) in her left calf. That's when this all started, not sure if theres a connection to anything there. She thinks something in the viviscal (shark cartilage she says) triggered this.To me, these symptoms seem to line up perfectly with ALS, especially since the IVIG didn't really help. However, I didn't expect the breathing issues in early stages of ALS to be this variable/extreme. Sometimes it is pretty extreme, and sometimes its ok.

c,"Actually, it took more than ten, but that is just the span of time between these two pictures.  I was at an all-time high in the first one.  This is only picture of me that exists from then because I wouldn’t allow anyone to photograph me as I was so ashamed of the way I looked — I still have issues with it due to my height.  But I am getting more comfortable with it every day. I went up and down in weight since my early twenties and had done every bullshit “diet” you could think of.  I would kill myself exercising for two - three hours some days only to eat everything back, not lose weight, get discouraged and give up.  Two years ago, I developed some work-related lower back and knee injuries that left me nearly immobile and unable to exercise.  I continued to gain, and my relationship at the time ended. I had never been so depressed that I was unable to eat — I would deal with trauma prior to this by stuffing my face with piles of shitty, fattening food; I tried that this time and it all turned to sawdust in my mouth.  I wanted nothing to do with any kind of food, so I just…stopped eating, I guess (note:  I DO NOT recommend doing this on purpose).  I figured that it wouldn’t even make any difference, because I knew that my body would go into “starvation mode” and I would just gain weight when I decided to finally eat because broken metabolism and science, right? However, I had begun cruising /r/fatlogic a couple months prior and while it stung reading a lot of the posts, I knew it was making me upset because I saw my own thinking reflected in so much of it.  I started challenging the things that I “knew” (like the “starvation mode” myth) and decided that if weight loss was really nothing but CICO, then I would just eat my shitty fucking food but maybe less of it.  The only exercise I could manage was walking, so I did that and tracked it, too.  Lo and behold, the weight started coming off in tiny bits each day. I got down to about 230 after about five months (starting point at the beginning of breakdown was about 275) and felt so much better, but my back pain was still a huge issue.  The “doctor” I was sent to by my employer’s insurance was completely worthless and did little to nothing to alleviate my pain (I would pretty much just sit on a table underneath a glorified heating pad for a half hour three times a week) so I knew that if I was going to try and truly make myself whole, I was going to have to do it on my own.  I signed up for Bikram yoga, which I had tried before and hated thanks to the misery of trying to balance 275+ lbs on one leg in a 105 degree room.  But this time, it was different — I pushed myself to improve but I didn’t beat myself up if I couldn’t do something as perfectly as I thought I should.   I kept going to hot yoga and focused on doing what my body would allow that day instead of berating myself for not being able to do certain parts.  After a while, my mobility not only began to come back, but started to be better then it ever had been before.  I kept up with CICO and the weight kept falling off, and I began to get toned, too.   Last month, I went to Belize with a friend and sprinted up the stairs of some Mayan ruins in about 30 seconds, something I would have probably never been able to do even in the “healthiest” times in my life.  A year prior to that, I was contemplating killing myself because I didn’t see the point in living as a miserable, fat, disabled mess anymore.  I’m not saying that things are perfect and I definitely still have issues with pain and other things but the only reason life got better for me was because I wanted it badly enough to force the changes that needed to happen in order to get there.

That I could go to work, come home and relax and be happy that I have a loving family. I wish I woke up feeling refreshed rather than sad that I have to act like I'm excited to start the day. Ultimately I think I'm at that phase in life where I've realized that I'm ultimately not going to have an impact on the world. I'll be forgotten and nothing I do will matter.

c,"YEP! Happened to me 2 summers ago. I was 24 at the time and I remember clear as day exactly when it happened. Before I dive into my story here's my demo: 24F, 5'1"", at the time farily active - was doing hot yoga &amp; running.  &amp;#x200B; I was near the end of cooking a mac &amp; cheese dinner (Chrissy Teigan's recipe.. go make it if you haven't yet!) and I felt a very sharp pain in my upper right back. Then came heart palpatations (which didn't worry me much. I experience them every couple days for about 10-30 seconds.) However on this night they lasted minutes longer. I was cooking for my current boyfriend- at that time we'd known each other for a very short time, few weeks.  I wrote my pain off until the next morning where I went into work like normal at a women's health clinic. I talked with one of our nurses and she took my vitals. Everything was normal - with my o2 sats at 100%. She told me I probably had a pinched nerve. I've had these before, in my hip - not back though but I knew medically I couldn't do anything about it besides icing/heat or whatever. So day 1 with my collapse lung I got though and wrote my pain off.  Day 3 I'm still experiencing the back pain and heart palpatations are more frequent than I'm used to. I end up going to an urgent care after work that day and the physician is concerned about the palpatations and advises me to go to the ER in case my birth control has caused a blot clot.  After leaving urgent care, I called my dad and consulted him. I REALLY didn't want to go to the ER because of the bill &amp; I knew if I wasn't having the palpatations when I was there, they would not find anything worth while. I went to a park and sat &amp; read for a little while. just trying to think about what I should do. When I was walking back to my car I noticed that I was walking slower than usual and I had to stop to rest after walking about half a block. Instantly I knew something was up and I really had to go to the ER.  I went in telling them I think somethings wrong with my heart, so I got back to a bed pretty quickly and they hooked me up with a bunch of monitoring wires. I sat there for a good 4 hours and was seriously ready to walk out and go home. They finally wheel me to a CT and not 5 minutes later a team of doctors enters the room and tell me I have a collapsed left lung and they need to put in a chest tube / put me under immedatiely. Didn't even give me time to text my mom.  Anyways, they still have no idea what caused it and also told me it's most common in tall, skinny males. NONE OF WHICH DEFINE ME LOL Last thing. My doctor told me the morning after that I could go back to work the following day or stay in the hospital for 3 days before they take the chest tube out. Worst decision was listening to him saying I can d/c. I didn't go back to work until the morning of day 3 becuase the pain was unbearable. &amp;#x200B; Hope you're doing better now!  &amp;#x200B;",0.514212,0.59124,0.55147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2538593481989708
s,"First off, he's nice. Really nice. He's also smart, and he makes me laugh. We've been dating for eight months now, and we almost never fight.  However, I think he sees me in the same light as his mother. She's a stay-at-home mom, though, and I want to be a working woman. He tells me things like, ""Oh, my mom genuinely loves doing laundry, really."" I've talked to her; she likes feeling needed, but laundry itself isn't fun. I cook for him and take care of him a lot. I do enjoy cooking (usually), but I wish he'd appreciate it more. I'm worried that I'm enabling his dependency, just like his mom.  Also, we have some major differences. Namely, I'm a staunch atheist, and he's a hardcore Christian. So far, we haven't had any real fights about it, but that's because one of us always backs down, not because our views are in any way compatible.  In addition, he's accidentally been ruining a lot of my friendships lately. He has back pain sometimes, and he's on meds that make him sick rather often. I want to go out on weekends with my friends. I'm in college; it's the best time to do it! However, I haven't been able to do this in weeks because my boyfriend suddenly feels very sick all the time, and he expects me to stay with him. Last night, I had friends over, and my boyfriend went to bed early. He was only a room away. I was just happy that I was finally getting to hang out with other people. He speechless with anger that I didn't come check on him to make sure he's okay.  He's also rather lazy. We don't go out much; hanging out with him is generally just studying or watching TV/movies. He's not cheap, he's just not very fun. This may also be my fault. I used to think of fun things and get people together to do them, but I don't anymore.  I do really like him, but I get annoyed by things like the ones I've mentioned. Also, I feel like I've changed while I'm with him; I watch more TV, and I don't maintain friendships as much, which I miss. I don't think I like the person I've become.  Should I try to salvage this?

s,"Hello there!A little background:I'm a 23M, 65kg and 182cm, and I have the Brugada Syndrome (Type 2)Previously had bilateral VATS sympathectomy, no significant surgery apart from that.I've got two little issues that I can't figure out, maybe I can get some advice here:1) Right upper back pain when neck and head point down (like when looking down)It feels like a nerve pinch about 2-3 fingers away from the spine towards the right and hurts very badly to look down (&lt;90˚) when this happens, so I'm forced to literally look straight or higher.There are aggravating and relieving factors though.Aggravating:\- Just woken up (literally cannot look down)\- Sitting for long periods of time (gets gradually more and more painful to look down)Relieving:\- Standing/walking a bit first (around 60 mins, no pain at all when looking down, but gets worse with inactivity)\- Back fully straightened (hurts less, but still hurts)\- Arching only neck and not pointing head down (same as above)This issue has been with me since as far back as I can remember, many many years ago when I was young.I must clarify that the sympathectomy had nothing to do with it, it started before it.I don't have a physically conducive home to do my work as I'm currently still studying, so I literally do everything on my bed with a bed top table, and now with covid, I'm sitting a lot more and it's a lot worse.I tried searching online but I can't find anything related to what I'm going through.2) Combination of multiple symptoms:a) Very heat intolerant and very excessive sweating\- I feel very warm when doing anything physical, and even at home with a fan blowing at me.\- I can walk &lt;100m and sweat through a tee shirt, it's that bad\- Standing still speeds up the sweating and feeling of warmth\- Sweating occurs over my whole body (except palms), and issue was since young, unrelated to compensatory sweating from sympathectomyb) Big appetite\- In the past, I'd binge eat a lot as I felt very hungry most of the time, and I can easily finish 2 regular (not personal) sized pizzas and have space for dessert.\- I don't notice any weight gain or weight loss, I'm skinny and small built\- Recently my appetite's gone down significantly, and I can have a heavy breakfast and not need to eat for the rest of the day, not feeling hungry at all.c) Cold intolerance\- If I feel very warm from a), entering a cold environment and resting for a bit (such as physically in school), I get cold very fast and sometimes shiver when others are comfortable.\- Sleep is greatly affected, as I mostly feel very warm when trying to sleep, then feeling very cold not long after falling asleepI suspected something wrong with my thyroid or its hormones, but I had a T4 and TSH test on 15 May 2020, and the results are normal(?):TSH: 1.89MU/LT4: 14.0 PMOL/LAny ideas on my two issues?Thanks for all of your help in advance!",0.0,0.0,0.550713,0.69652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24497991967871485
s,"Hi all, I'm a little bit worried. This is really long, but I think everything I'm writing may be relevant. I'm trying to figure out if its more likely that I have Chronic Kidney Disease, Renal Failure, or just kidney stones aka urolithiasis.So, I'm a 26 year old male, 6'1"" 175 lbs, and overall pretty healthy/active, at least I've thought. But I might not eat enough food. (I try not to over eat because lots of 1st year lawyers put on a lot of weight.) Also, I should mention that I am reluctant to go to a doctor because I have no insurance, no money to pay for a doctor, and was hoping to not go into more debt other than my already existing giant school loans. My school's extension on insurance only went to 11/30/18, and my new policy starts on 1/1/19. I just finished law school, now being paid $48k a year for the first year, no benefits, small shop firm, huge student loan debt. Immediate symptoms: (1) middle back pain, pretty much below the ribcage, towards the center and near my spine; (2) frothy urine. Thurday: So, I have my medical background listed below, and I will just write here what concerns I have. So my therapist suggested that I get a daily vitamin, and get some vitamin D. She says that I likely have a D deficiency, and I have been diagnosed with dysthymia. Primary symptoms of my depression have been low energy, trouble paying attention, and.. they kinda add up to a mild case of anemia. After buying the vitamins, I took both at about 5:30PM on Thursday of last week. 3 hours later, I went to a trivia night with my roommates, and drank 2 ""pimms cups"" total. I didn't pee until I went home, but I peed with the lights off (I hit the wrong switch and didn't feel like stopping the stream). I went home, I went to sleep, and this is when woke up with really bad back pain. Friday: At first I thought that I slept funny, and so I stretched and did a foam roller. The pain didn't ever fully subside, but because I didn't have any other symptoms at all, I brushed it off as just part of being 26 years old and drinking on a weeknight. But then I peed for the first time that day. Which is odd to pee so late for me. My urine was very very dark. I then filled up my water bottle and chugged a ton of water. My urine was relatively clear therein. At about 4PM I took the vitamin again with some food while at work. I didn't think anything of it. Later that night, I went to my SOs holiday party, open bar, drank a lot, probably close to a whole bottle of wine, and a whiskey drink. I was pretty drunk, and I even left my winter gloves in the cab ride home. Saturday: I woke up, surprisingly not that hungover. Took adderall again, and then chugged water. Eventually I peed, and it was later in the morning again. This time my urine was highlighter yellow, which was bizarre. It was ALSO frothy. I did a bit of googling, and determined that that the color was likely due to an excess of Riboflavin. My vitamin supplement has 1500% of the daily needs of Riboflavin, so that likely caused that. As such, I did not take the vitamin supplement on Saturday. But I didn't think anything else about the foamy urine, because I've had that before, especially when I drank a lot. On Saturday night, I went out and drank 3 glasses of wine at my friend's holiday party. Sunday: no hangover, but my urine in the morning (at a normal time) was frothy. The frothiness persisted this time, so I googled it. What does google say? Kidney failure. BUT I didn't want to believe that, so I tried to figure out why that is NOT the case. I don't think thats the case, because I don't have any other symptoms that they listed. So I've been drinking LOTS of water, eating less protein, bought lemon juice, eating foods that ""good for the kidneys"" according to google.Changes in my life that I've made:So normally I eat tons of dairy. All the dairy. But I've kinda cut it out, and gluten, just to test it out. But I definitely still have both from time to time. I've been concerned about skin outbreaks, and acne, and these little weird cyst type things that form in my follicles, which kind of look like Keratosis Pilaris, but are also go deeper and are kind of cystic in nature, but still quite small. They present as little bumps, that continue to grow until the follicle becomes swollen. The most afflicted areas are my extremeties. They are not typical acne, and seem to not relate to subaceous glands at all. I also have wisdom teeth that are always swollen. I had an abscess 2 months ago, and I have to take antibiotics (mostly amoxicillin) to treat the issue. For the abscess, I took augmentin. I did not drink while taking any antibiotics. But I've done 5 full loads of antibiotics in the last 4 months. I cannot (easily) get my wisdom teeth out, because they are tangled in the nerves that control my ability to keep liquids in my mouth, smile, etc. Its a high risk procedure, so I decided not to get them out. Now I'm thinking I should not have gone that route, because I believe the antibiotics, in conjunction with the adderall has caused kidney issues. Substances I take regularly: - Alcohol: 2-3 times a week- Adderall XR 30mg a day. I've been taking it long-term, for about a 1.5 years now. I took vyvanse before that. Started taking ADHD stimulants when I was 10. - ibuprofen 3-6 per week. - a daily vitamin (which I stopped taking) - I had a cold 2 weeks ago, and I drank lots of gatorade.My history: 1. When I was 12,13, my pediatrician noted that my urine sample had a high level of ""protein""2. A few years ago (2015), my blood test showed the my albumin levels were slightly low, but still within safe parameters. 3. The reason why I was having those blood tests was because I was taking accutane. Family history: My sister was born with Urinary Reflux, and caused some kidney scarring, but she's fine now. The fact that my urine is frothy has me really freaked out. Will someone please tell me what I should do? What is most likely? ",0.546317,0.532099,0.79081,0.545551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18468468468468469
s,"So I’ve been feeling unwell for about six months now, so far doctors haven’t found a cause, and lately I’ve been feeling really depressed because of it. I’ve been having back pain, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and daily fevers. The fevers are what is really wearing me down, I constantly feel ill or like I’m getting ill. This all also started during a really rough time in my marriage where I felt that my husband was being emotionally abusive and now I’m starting to wonder if this relationship is what’s making me so sick. In December I had a lymph node biopsied from my neck to check for malignancy (it came back negative). Leading up to the surgery I was really scared and anxious.. I couldn’t talk to my husband about any of it because it was annoying to him and he didn’t take it seriously. We were also fighting a lot and he would say thinks like he hopes I die of cancer, he hopes I die during surgery, he thinks I have cancer eating away at my brain making me crazy or stupid.. Really mean, hurtful shit. The day of the surgery he was there for me and acted all supportive and caring but I almost didn’t want him there at that point. Then like two days after the surgery he didn’t believe that I was still in pain and tired from it, he said I was using it as an excuse to be lazy. Things got even worse between us and I had made up my mind that I need to leave him after Christmas (we have kids so I didn’t want to mess up their holiday). I am also completely dependent on him right now and have no family or friends that can help me, so I don’t even know how I could manage to leave him. I kind of feel trapped. But once the holidays had passed he started acting a lot differently, somewhat apologized for some things, and we haven’t been fighting much since then. So here I stay. Yesterday I had an OBGYN appointment and the doctor felt a couple lumps in one of my breasts, on the same side as I’ve had swollen lymph node for months too. She is sending me for an ultrasound but told me not to worry about it in the meantime (which is easier said than done). I texted my husband and told him about my appointment- that I was switching my birth control, getting blood work, and about the lumps. He responded to me about the birth control but didn’t mention anything else. Later he came home from work and he had made another comment about the b/c but didn’t mention the breast exam or ask how the appointment was. I felt really hurt by this because I was worried about it and wanted some emotional support from him and it made me feel like he didn’t care or even consider my feelings. I didn’t want to bring it up because then I feel like I’m feeding into his image of me as an annoying hypochondriac. Eventually I couldn’t keep it to myself anymore and I confronted him about it and said that he makes me feel like he doesn’t care about my shit and like I have to deal with everything on my own. I brought up the fact that I’ve been feeling so sick too but I can’t ever talk to him about it and he never asks me how I feel or anything. He got super defensive and said I was being unreasonable and attacking him and insulting him by saying he doesn’t care. He said he was busy at work and only actually read half of the text message and I shouldn’t have assumed that he had read it, because if he had then he would’ve definitely said something. Idk whether to believe him or not, because sometimes I feel like he purposely does shit like that to make me feel insignificant, but I accepted his version of what happened and said fine. Then this morning, I wasn’t feeling well and he accused me of having an attitude with him and then I pretty much yelled at him to get off of my case. We had a short argument and I left for class. I sent him a long text message explaining how I’ve been feeling because I’ve been keeping it almost entirely to myself and these past few days I’ve just been feeling like I can’t go on. He read it as I was complaining about him and I just don’t see how that’s the main thing he took away from the message. Did I really come off that way? https://imgur.com/a/aPLNxI’ve ended up feeling even worse about everything since that conversation.. Now I feel like I definitely can’t and shouldn’t rely on him for emotional support and I shouldn’t tell him anything. It just sucks because I literally have no one else. And being sick is making me feel like I’m going crazy, wondering if I am making myself sick, or being unreasonable by worrying about it, and like I’m too weak to do what I need to do in life or to make any changes. I guess I really just came here to vent and get some outside perspective. Thanks. TL:DR My husband [37M] hasn’t been giving me the emotional support that I [28F] want and need as I deal with health problems and now depression. I opened up to him and he feels attacked. Not sure what I should do, but I need to do something because life is too hard for me right now and I feel completely helpless to fix anything.

So I am asking if anyone has any experience with back braces? Do they alleviate the pain even so slighty? Also worth to note is that the most comfortable position for the relative is when they are standing. Your answers will be greatly appreciated.",0.0,0.681401,0.599687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38

c,"Hey thanks for your input, vigatron.  Maybe your body proportions are different than mine, but for the day that I used my keyboard on my lap, it felt pretty comfortable. My wrists were straight. My forearms were not perfectly level with the ground, instead having maybe a 5% downward angle. The biggest annoyance was that anytime I would need to get up, I'd have to pickup the keyboard and stash it on the table. Second was that my mouse still had to siton the table top about 5"" above. My wrist was not straight when mousing and I began to feel discomfort as a result of that. (I'm confident that this would lead to pain with prolonged use) A description of my setup: dining table repurposed into a desk, initially I was using a regular wooden dining chair, laptops, one external monitor, mouse and keyboard. I elevated the two laptops on top of telephone books.  With this initial setup, I found that I'd have tightness in my shoulders and my butt would hurt. My shoulders would hurt because the table top was too high and I would subconsciously raise my shoulders to compensate. My butt would hurt because, well, it's a wooden dining chair. Lol. I put some cushions on it to raise myself up, but then my feet were off the ground, which led to back pain (a box for a foot rest kind of helped). Then I remembered that, duh, I have a Steelcase office chair in my bedroom. It's basic, but it's still loads better than a wooden dining chair. Who knew that cushioning, wheels, and tilt could improve comfort so much?? I tried the keyboard on the lap, and that was OK, but imperfect.  Keyboard tray most likely will not work on my table because it's got a 3"" lip that hangs down. I shopped adjustable height office chairs online and was preparing to buy when I remembered that I had a little something that could help...

c,"The heroin epidemic can mostly be attributed to the government crackdown on oxycontin and prescription opiates, not marijuana legalization. I'm originally from Eastern KY, so I saw this firsthand. From around 2000 - 2010 or so you could find pills anywhere. Doctors were pushing them on people for any reason they could prescribe them. They'd give you oxycontin (a drug made for cancer patients) for back pain, injuries at work, migraines. My dad worked in a hospital and he'd see drug reps taking doctors out to dinner, paying for cruises, etc. People would drive down to Florida, hit up a dozen ""pain clinics"" and then bring them back home and sell them. Shortly after Obama took office the DEA finally started cracking down on how easy it was to get prescriptions. Penalties for getting caught selling prescription narcotics also got more severe. With prescription opiates now very scarce, addicts had to turn to heroin to get their fix. While overdoses were still out of hand when prescription narcotic abuse was high, heroin is a million times more dangerous since there is no way to know how potent the stuff you're shooting up is.  Most people really don't understand how serious this problem is in Appalachia. I bet least half of the people I started high school with had died from overdoses before senior year. Every single week someone I knew was dying from oxycontin. I know of many young children who were orphaned, both parents dead from overdoses.

Not just in terms of getting your guard passed or losing position, but in the levels of physical risk in play when you try to invert etc. Now you can either take the approach of ""if I make my back stronger I can take the pressure"" and keep trying to deal with this by forcing a vertebra vs top pressure battle, or you can go the route of ""I'm gonna make my back stronger to help prevent injuries, but I'm not going have a battle of my vertebra vs their top pressure"".

s,"Hi everyone!I've been suffering from back pain for the last few months and its really been affecting me and my life overall, and its taken a huge toll on my mental health. Let me preface this by saying I've been actually going through two medical problems at the same time that i've assumed are related and have brought up to doctors numerous times. Here are a few of my stats:Age: 23Sex: FemaleHeight: 175cmWeight: Currently 210lbs. Fluctuates a lot and have lost about 20 lbs through diet and exercise since august, although not consistent. I do not smoke or drink. No one food allergies or intolerances. I Other than the back pain, my other medical issue is IBS-like symptoms. I have always had problems with constipation and I sometimes just cannot go no matter what. My feces literally become so dry that they cannot pass without laxatives, stool softeners or glycerin suppositories. I have not recently taken any of the above other than milk of magnesia every few days which really seems to get things going but i worry about become too reliant on it. I never feel completely emptied out. Onto the back pain. The first day I noticed the back pain was October 5. It is on my left side and it is constant and sharp and dull at the same time if that makes any sense. If i were to have to pick I would say it is sharp and aching. I provided a link to the closest image on google i could find. In the image, the area labelled as cholecystitis is where it hurts HOWEVER my pain is on the left side ONLY. I was not exercising at the time when I first felt the pain, so I don't think I hurt myself or pulled anything. Before this I had never even experienced back pain. I assumed this is what people experience when they feel back pain so I just took some tylenol which didn't help. I tried Robax, Voltaren, Deep Relief Gel and nothing seemed to help longer than 5 minutes.  I headed over to my doctor who told me its a muscle pain and to wait it out for a few weeks. Fair enough. A few weeks go by and it's getting worse, so bad that one day I visit the urgent care after doing some googling, thinking maybe I have a kidney infection. I've had a really bad one before and the pain wasn't THAT different from what i could remember, just in a different spot. The doctor told me it is flank pain and did an ultra sound (they only put gel on the front) and told me everything is normal and to wait it out. I again waited it out a few weeks and returned to a different doctor who prescribed me a muscle relaxant, which i stopped taking after 2 weeks because they did not make a difference. He gave me a referral to a chiropractor which I unfortunately cannot afford. Again, I returned to the urgent care when it got really bad again. \*\*\* I began to noticed that when I feel the pain, i sometimes feel it in the front (directly in front of where I feel the back pain) and I feel rumbling/things moving in the spot it hurts. I began to think it was related to my constipation/IBS symptoms and brought it up to the doctor who dismissed this. I'm aware my colon is in the area and have been worried it may have to do with that, however I did have the ultrasounds done which would rule it out I think? I added a link to a gallery of 29 pictures which is all i received. This is my first time using this so hopefully it worked.These were the findings of that ultra sound:[https://imageshack.com/user/throw9876awaysS](https://imageshack.com/user/throw9876awaysS)   ultrasound. I do not think it has anything to do wiht my kidney or bladder if anything my colon but again i am desperate!!MUS 7564 RENAL - LTD.

I did bring up my colon but it appears they only took photos of my bladder and kidney.&amp;#x200B;He made me do a few stretches such as touching my toes and twisting and again told me its a muscle pain. I visiting another doctor, same thing not related to my IBS. It does not help that I am between family doctors, but I was in the process of moving. Finally I visited a doctor who believed the symptoms are related. She was shocked that no one performed an XRAY and I finally got that done, it came back fine just told me I am really constipated. I do not have access to the XRAY. She told me to try dulcolax which kinda worked but it only seemed to be water coming out. I tried some orange solution that i cannot remember the name of, it was very sweet almost had a honey flavour and this did not work at all. Metamucil had mixed results. She suggested experimenting with my diet which I have done over the years. I triied cutting pretty much everything out except gluten which I haven't tried yet. I've dried a high fibre diet and I drink around 2L of water a day. Finally, we discovered that milk of magnesia works to get things going and she told me to take magnesium citrate once a month. I visited this same doctor again to let her know that while the milk of magnesia does work, i still cannot go without it and my back pain was still there. She ""diagnosed"" me with IBS but recommended getting a family doctor (she's not accepting patients) to rule everything else out.  This was early January and then all of a sudden the pain went away.  I was prescribed dicetel 2x a day which almost seemed to help. &amp;#x200B;The pain returned as bad as ever this week. I officially moved in the middle of January and am now too far away and need to get a family doctor. I have called all the family doctors near me and no one is accepting new patients right now, and the only think I can do it is be putting on a provincial waiting list (i'm in canada). I am incredibly desperate right now and I appreciate anyone that made it this far and is willing to point me in the right direction. The only thing that makes me doubt the fact is it not related to my other symptoms is the fact that I usually wake up with minimal pain and it gets worse as the day progressed.A few extra things:\- I do sometimes have black specs? that i notice in my feces after I wipe\- Before any of this happened I had another medical mystery that was hard to explain. One day I had very sharp shooting pains that almost felt like they were going up my urethra and for the next two weeks I underwent hell symptoms similar to a UTI infection on steroids. Burning urethra, shooting pains, constant need to urinate but not much urine. It almost felt like where I imagine my cervix is what in shooting pain as well? I had it looked at and other than it being a little inflamed, everything looked fine. At one point I was balling my eyes out in the tub. I underwent many tests and pelvic exams and no one could figure out what on earth was wrong with me. I also had STI tests that all came back negative (I've had one sexual partner that I am in a relationship with for the past three years if this makes any difference). For some reason, everyone refused to look inside me lol (other than pelvic exams). No one performed an ultrasound or xray, but I did get referred to a gynaecologist after the doctor said it might be interstitial cystitis. That night i got home from the hospital and was in excruciating pain to a point i wasn't eating anymore. Apologize if this is gross but I slept in the bath water trying to urinate because it was so painful. My boyfriend was really concerned and left numerous voicemails to the gynecologist because we needed answers ASAP. After that night, it went away and has not come back! Again it seems like a very different problem than the back pain but I do not want to rule anything out.

s,"it’s such a mystery to me! i (24f) have constant lower back pain and tightness on my left side, and no other activity (weights, yoga, swimming) has helped to the extent running does. i run medium distances, about 10-20km a day 4-5 days a week.i took four 1.5 week breaks from running this year, and noticed that the pain and tightness completely disappear once i’m 2-3 days back into my regular running schedule afterward. all the explanations i’ve found online have to do with the muscles running builds, but i feel like the fact that the pain and tightness come in after 3 days without running can’t be due to muscle loss/degradation (same to be said about the fact that it disappears so quickly when i start up again). can anyone clarify what’s going on? i’m about to enter a two month period during which i won’t be able to run, and am wondering if there’s something i can do to prevent back pain during this time. thanks in advance!",0.0,0.613953,0.0,0.833641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35294117647058826
c,"Yep, same boat here. I got ignored and had my pain downplayed for: period cramps causing me to black out and/or induced migraines; regular migraines; a sports injury in high school; a 4 month long respiratory infection from mold in my dorm room in college; my depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation upon having to move back in with my folks during college. * The sports injury is my favorite, though. I told my coaches that I was having back pain, so they put me on some restrictions for a week. This went on for about a month until I was restricted from participating in practices at all, and rest-ice-compression and stretching my knee (trainer suggestion) wasn’t doing shit for my back. My dad’s quote was “suck it up buttercup.” My parents got lectured by the coaches for blowing off my pain, so I ended up in 8 weeks of physical therapy for sciatica between seasons. Spring season starts, my pain comes back (*because it’s not sciatica and my childhood doc sucks*). I tell my parents hey my back is hurting again, because they loved saying “oh you can tell us anything and you can come to us for anything.” I got told I’m making it up and it’s fine, I need to be better about doing the sciatica exercises I got from physical therapy. Apparently it was my fault my back still hurts, I just wasn’t trying hard enough to fix it. The pain was also in my head, according to my dad. My request to go back to physical therapy was denied—no reason, I had a packet of print outs from the clinic that would accomplish the exact same thing as more hands-on treatment [*aka my parents didn’t want to spend the money again because my pain was inconvenient and invisible to them*]. I start being unable to run again—shocker—and my coaches notice. When the head coach asks, I tell her I’m having back pain and  shared a couple of choice things my parents said to me. That woman took my parents aside and gave them an *earful.*  We got home and my folks started asking me, angrily, **why I never said anything!** I told them I did, but I was told to “sUcK iT uP bUtTeRCuP.” (Oh that pissed them off and it was worth it!) My dad took my mom’s blame for my back injury getting ignored for over 6 months total, and I never received further medical attention to my back. They do not recall, of course.  That was 12 years ago. I’m pushing 30 now, still have the chronic non-sciatica back pain, problems identifying my own illness severity and voicing when I’m in pain, and a lifelong mistrust of doctors....

s,"I'm trying to loose weight/tone up. I've done at home walking programs and outdoor walking programs before and while they do help with weight loss, they don't really tone/build muscle all that much. I decided to try P90 on Beachbody on Demand. HUGE mistake. I loved the program, but holy crap! After about 4 days, my sciatica started kicking up a stink so bad! I only have a few battles with this stupid nerve each year, so I thought it was just because I was working out in a new way, and I just kept doing sciatica stretches to relieve the pain. That worked at first, but by day 8-9 I realized I was suffering pretty bad, as in NOTHING was making the discomfort stop. It didn't even occur to me that it was the exercises themselves, and not just that it was new. I just sort of assumed the flair up was like sore muscles and eventually it'd go away. Turns out almost every exercise the program used were no-no's for sciatica. I immediately stopped the program (thankfully before my 2 free weeks trial ended) and within 2 days the pain subsided and went away. So, now I'm left here wondering what exercises I can do that will help me tone up, build muscle and loose weight that won't aggravate this stupid nerve.  Does anyone have any suggestions? I'm really bad a putting together my own workouts, so if anyone has a list, or a program they use, I would be forever grateful for any suggestions. I should mention I'm female, do not have access to a gym, and work full time. I have a few free weights and an elliptical, but that's it. Any thoughts, suggestion, tips?

s,"It's now been over 2 weeks since I received shot #2 of Moderna so I am now supposedly ""fully vaccinated"". I think it's time to share my record of what I personally experienced with both Moderna shots. I wonder how many people here experienced the same thing, especially the time when they experienced these effects. Anyway, stay healthy and safe!-----------------------------**Basic Information:**Vaccine: ModernaShot #1 on Left Arm: April 25, 2021Shot #2 on Left Arm: May 23, 2021Sex: MaleAge Range: 27-49Prior Coronavirus Exposure: NONEPain Tolerance: High------------------------------**Summarized Experiences:****Shot #1 Experiences:**Injection Site Pain (aka covid arm) - intense pain that became mild quickly, non-issue. Returned around 2 weeks later as an itchy, non-painful lump, but disappeared.Headache and Fever, Chills - high fever, mildly annoying headache, chills, immediately disappeared after some sleep and rest.Heart Palpitations - happened randomly, mild, controlled with deep breathing.Numbness of Left Arm - short duration.Left Hand Weakness and Tingling Sensation - short duration.Feeling of Something Heavy on Chest - moderate annoyance, had to breathe through mouth most of the time, couldn't sleep lying down so I had to turn on my side, disappeared after a few days.**Shot #2 Experiences:**Injection Site Pain (aka covid arm) - intense pain, definitely worse than the one from shot #1, but disappeared quickly, returned a week later as an itchy lump but immediately disappeared.Headache and Fever, Chills - exponentially more intense than shot #1, it was so bad I felt like I was burning while freezing, headache was definitely more painful, this was not the normal kind of fever, it's the worst I've had in my life.Heart Palpitations, Hard to Breathe - worse than the first time, forced to sleep on my side because it was hard to breathe flat on my back, lasted around 2 weeks.Loss of Balance - lasted for almost 2 weeks, very terrible feeling, I wasn't confident of going out to drive, forced to stay home.Diarrhea - explosive liquid diarrhea, happened within an hour of eating a meal, lasted for a while.Right Knee to Toes Numbness - randomly happened, lasted for a day.------------------------------------**Summary:**Shot #2 was in a different league compared to shot #1. I have high tolerance for pain and I don't even take pain relievers, but what made me suffer was the breathing problem which forced me to sleep on my side. It's especially worrying because I have high blood pressure. Despite having high blood pressure since childhood, I was never forced to sleep on my side because of being unable to breathe while on my back. I needed to constantly do deep breathing to try and slow down my heart. This was something I only experienced after the vaccine. The loss of balance problem was also quite surprising. Although I've experienced this sort of thing before whenever I got extremely sick to the point of hospitalization, I never experienced it for such a long duration! It stayed with me for quite some time even after the extremely high fever disappeared. I find this very strange. Thankfully it's gone now.Two weeks after shot #2, it seems I'm back to normal.Thankfully, from the beginning of shot #1 to the end of the second week of shot #2, I never experienced the swollen lymph node problem or the cramps that other people have suffered. Those were things I never wanted to experience, especially the cramps because I know how painful those can be. I hope that I'll never experience anymore weird effects in the future. For now, this vaccine record of mine is finished.--------------------------------------**More Detailed Record:****Pre-existing Conditions:**- High Blood Pressure- Hypothyroidism- Lower Back Pain- Side Body Pain- Left and Right Knee Pain- Feet Pain - TinnitusDoctor: Never seen a doctor since 2004, stopped taking heart high blood pressure medicine, don't have the money for that, I just powered through whatever pain or sickness came my way. Only time I took pain reliever was for toothache and that was long ago.**Night Before Appointment:**- 3 hours of sleep, couldn't sleep at all and got woken up too early. Spent so much time reading and preparing for potential horrible side effects.- Ate only canned pineapples and mandarin. Sucked the juice out of canned sweet corn, spat out the rest. I needed to time my poo before 1pm vaccine appointment. Pineapples and mandarin sure did it for me. Last thing I wanted to happen was poo at CVS, I don't like public restrooms and they're probably closed anyway!- I'm a heavy drinker of juice and water so even before I got signed up for vaccination, I was already always hydrated.---------------------------**April 25, 2021**1:15pm - arrived at CVS, kept massaging and moving left arm to prepare it for injection. I read somewhere that this is a good way to lessen the left arm pain.1:30pm - Moderna Shot 1, was told to stay in the store for 15 minutes.1:45pm - 2:00pm - heavy, stinging sensation on left arm injection site. Kept moving it around in an attempt to make the pain go away just like what people online said. It seemed I succeeded. Bought Tylenol PM just in case some kind of unbearable pain occurs. Heart rate seems to have jumped while I was moving around in the CVS store, but I performed an inhale/exhale move to make it go down. It seemed to work as well.2:00pm - 2:30pm - heavy, almost numb feeling on left arm injection site down to elbow, as if you slept on it. Continued left arm movement just to make sure the stinging pain stays gone. I hope it stays that way.2:30pm - 3:15pm - weakened left hand grip with slightly numb sensation as if you slept on it. Laying tummy down on bed while typing this on computer.  Left hand grip seems to have strenghtened a bit near to full power. Most numbness gone, injection site of course still feels weird but possible to move around. No other weird feelings yet, but I'm expecting them to show up in a few hours, just like what happened to other people.3:30pm - I have an extremely relaxed feeling, heart rate seems to be at the normal range of non-highblood people, which is weird because I have highblood pressure and my heart is supposed to be always a little faster than the average person's.5:00pm - Chills, cold fingers, cold feet. I'm used to these as I always feel them at night, nothing new. I like cold so it doesn't bother me. I feel there is a fever, the hot but cold type. Nothing unusual, I also feel this way mostly at night. I fell asleep while playing GTA V.7:00pm - woke up. Headache, not bad. Less worse than headache from not eating for a day. This headache is more comparable to a whole day of working in front of a computer and just wanting to eat. Nothing horrible yet.7:20pm - No more weird arm feeling, easy to move for now. Hot and cold feverish feeling is still there.11:00pm - ate Dominos Extravaganza pizza, 4 large slices, spat out remaining 4 since it's gonna be too much but I still wanted to taste it while watching stuff online.--------------------------**April 26, 2021**2:40am - no more chills, seems like no more fever, no real pain on injection site. Watching shows online and playing games.4:00am - went to sleep.8:30am - woke up, sweaty legs. Went back to sleep. Injection site feels bruised. 11:30am - woke up, sweaty legs. Went back to sleep. Injection site still feels bruised.4:30pm - woke up, no more sweaty legs. Injection site still feels bruised so I forced to move it around. Bruised feeling diminished. Refreshed feeling. Strangely, my pre-existing joint and muscle pain seem to be not present. Maybe it's because of the good chopped up sleep.5:30pm - ate tempura shrimps.9:00pm - injection site feeling less bruised.---------------------------------------------**April 27, 2021**12:00am - ate teriyaki chicken.5:30am - went to sleep2:30pm - woke up, slightly sweaty legs, injection site pain is almost all gone.4:30pm - ate Dinty Moore stew with spaghetti, spat out most since there's too many and I don't want to be full but still wanted to taste it.---------------------------------------------**April 28, 2021**4:30am - ate canned pineapples.5:00am - injection site pain is barely noticeable even if you bump it on objects. 8:30am - went to sleep.1:30pm - woke up, nothing strange so far.3:30pm -  ate more Dinty Moore stew, plain, no spaghetti.

This is infinitely worse than shot #1. I continued moving around the left arm despite the pain because that's how I made it go away during shot #1.----------------------------------------------**May 25, 2021**12:00am - ate tamarind soup with okra, ham and rice, injection site pain seems to have diminished a little, there's still horrible burning sensation that I had to turn on the aircon to cool myself down, strong headache on left side of the brain, overall feeling of tiredness and sluggishness, loss of balance is still bad. 7:00am - less painful injection site, less fever, less headache pain on the left side of the brain, still feeling very tired, still have horrible sense of balance, I just went to sleep.4:00pm - woke up, injection site pain is almost non-existent, minor fever, headache seems to have disappeared, still have weird sense of balance, ate tamarind soup with okra, ham and rice.4:30pm - diarrhea blast after eating.8:00pm - another diarrhea blast, I knew it was the okra that went out this time, I could feel the little okra seeds streaming out.9:00pm - my stomach still feels like it's gonna have diarrhea, it's rumbling but it's not forcing anything out, it's manageable now but not completely gone.

s,"My father and my mother are separating for good. No one blames my father. It's been a very difficult for him. My mom has been mentally ill since as long as I could remember. She has bipolar disorder and severe depression, and in the past decade she's gotten much worse. She hasn't worked in years and is on disability for the rest of her life. My mother absolutely cannot support herself. There is no question.She was also prescribed the wrong dosage of medicine for her bipolar disorder for a while, and it caused brain damage, leaving her mentally handicapped. She has the mental capacity of a 6 year old, although I was recently told that she's going to be taking classes and starting at a 4th grade level.Being around my mother is extremely difficult.  She goes through manic depressive states very often, which means she'll all of a sudden flip out. It's mostly for this reason that she cannot maintain any sort of relationship with anyone around her. It's like a 6 year old tantrum. And is often extremely inappropriate.She probably has, maybe, 1 original thought a day. The rest of the time she just repeats herself over and over again. And she never stops talking.My siblings and I cannot bring significant others home. We don't know what my mom will say. She has no filter. In the past she has walked around the house in her underwear in front of my brother's (30m) girlfriend and also on a separate occasion in front of my sister's (28f) boyfriend.About two years ago she fell and broke her leg. She's in constant pain from this and also back pain. I'm told she can't drive, or even get out of bed most days. Since my mom has had multiple suicide attempts, the earliest being about a year ago, I've suggested trying to put her into the hospital for good. My father always told me she was getting better, but it was obvious that he was in denial or he's just been around her too long to differentiate a normal day for my mother and normal behavior.My father has finally had it. He can't take care of my mother anymore, it's ruining his mental health. And again, no one blames him. It's difficult for my sister and I to even have a phone conversation with her. I can't imagine living with it every day. She's either yelling at us, telling us how depressed she is and how much she hates her life, or repeating the same story for the 40th time. You honestly can't even get a word in. She just talks nonsense. She calls me on a daily basis. Most of the voicemails she leaves are of her crying and telling me to call her back because it's an emergency or it's ""very important."" It never is. She just tells us the same thing, about all her problems.I don't know what will happen to my mother. I haven't done any research yet into long term care. My parents don't have any money, my brother has no job and still lives with them, and my sister and I have roommates and wouldn't be able to take care her in. I know it sounds selfish, but I don't know if I could do it mentally even if I were in the position to. She's such a drain on my mental health.Anyway, I was hoping I could get some advice from anyone who has had a family member that needed similiar full-time, long-term care. Supporting herself is not an option. I don't know if state health insurance would cover the care that she needs. I honestly don't even know where to start. I didn't think I'd have to making these decisions for a few more years.TL;DR My dad is my mom's caregiver and is leaving her. She can't support herself and I don't know how to handle the situation or what steps to take.",0.0,0.676739,0.862716,0.658302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22036474164133737

c,"Gretchen found herself home for the third weekend in a row to study for an extremely important final. She’d just changed out of her work clothes and into sweat pants and a tube top. She sat, cross legged on her bed, and just turned to the fourth chapter in her *Basic Human Anatomy* textbook when her roommate, Nadia knocked one the door. “Hey, roomie,” she said, smiling. “I was wondering if you could do me a favour?” Gretchen sighed. She already knew what the favour would be. It was the same favour she had asked for every weekend since they first met.  See, Gretchen was gifted with a large chest. Ever since she hit puberty, they just kept expanding. She had to wear two sports bras to run comfortably. She didn’t mind them most days, but the staring could be rather annoying when she was just trying to raise her hand, or stretch, or just move. Then Gretchen met Nadia, an attractive girl, Asian. She was petite, with jet black hair. Nadia seemed drawn to Gretchen from the first day they met. It was at a party. Gretchen wore a dress that showed off her generous cleavage—one of the few times she was willing to do so. She and Nadia hung out more frequently after that. Next thing Gretchen knew, they moved in together.  Nadia turned out to be something of a party animal. She was always bringing guys over for a good time. It didn’t really start affecting Gretchen until one particular night, very much like tonight, when Nadia knocked on Gretchen’s door and said, “Can you do me a favour?” Tonight, Gretchen slammed her book shut. “Uh uh. No way. This is the third weekend in a row. I’m putting my foot down. I’m going to Starbucks to study.” “Oh, come on!” Nadia begged. “It’s not like you’re using them. Meanwhile, Travis is coming by and...well, I met him on tinder...” “I can’t believe you,” Gretchen said, shaking her head. “You still have that picture up?” “It gets a lot of traffic,” Nadia said. “It’s simple marketing. Guys aren’t used to seeing an Asian with tits like yours. C’mon! You lend me your tits for the weekend and you can go out to study and not have guys oggle you.” “Why don’t you just find someone else?” I asked.  “Because I don’t trust anyone with my secret,” Nadia said. “Imagine what the government would do if they found out what I could do?” I raised an eyebrow. “What would the government do with you knowing you can just switch breasts with other girls?” “I don’t know. You know how those guys are. They’re always up to shifty, devious shit. C’mon. Help a girl out. I already promised Travis he could titfuck me. There’s no way I could do it with these.” She lifted her shirt, revealing a pair of perky A cup breasts.  “That’s what you get for putting up that picture on Tinder. It’s never going to end, is it? You’re just going to keep asking me until I just give in and let you keep them.” “I wasn’t planning on that,” Nadia said. “But now that you mention it, you’re right. It’s tedious. So how about this. You give me your tits permanently, and I’ll give you 10,000 dollars.” “You’re kidding me,” Gretchen laughed.  “This way, you get peace of mind, and I get a nice set of boobs to enjoy. Win-win.” “Where did you get $10,000?” I demanded. “I saved it up,” Nadia answered. “Mostly by showing your boobs on snap chat...Which is another reason I want them.” Gretchen thought it over. $10,000 was some serious cash. It could help with the rent. It could help with her student debt. And Gretchen would be able to walk around with out back ache.  “50,000, and you’ve got a deal.” Gretchen said. Nadia laughed. “No way!” “So you *do* have the money.” “Well...yes. But...” “And these,” she said placing her hands under her chest, “got you that money?” “They did...Mostly. Some of the pictures are of stuff that I grew myself.” “Which means they’re valuable.” Nadia nodded, reluctantly. “Well, I’m not parting with them for less than $50,000. Take it or leave it.” “Alright, alright. I’ll transfer the money over. But we’ve got a deal.” Gretchen sighed and pulled off her tube top. Nadia took off her top as well and walked up to Gretchen, placing both hands on Gretchen’s breast. Nadia’s hands glowed bright white, spreading warmth throughout Gretchen’s chest. Nadia began groping her roommate’s buxom chest, kneading them with her thumbs, massaging them, pinching the nipples until the two glorious mounds began to shrink inward.  The remarkable thing about Nadia’s strange power was that it didn’t just exchange size, but shape and perkiness. Gretchen’s breasts deflated slowly, going down from DDD to C, then B, and finally an A cup. What were once two weighty mountains became tiny hills on the valley that was Gretchen’s torso. They had a sort of torpedo shape to them.  At the same time, Nadia’s breasts ballooned outward, taking on a teardrop shape. Her nipples lightened to a rosy pink, while Gretchen’s became a darker brown. Nadia’s nipples moved closer to the centre of her chest, while Gretchen’s moved outward, poking out further than they used to. Nadia’s hands rushed to her new endowments. “Worth it! You won’t be sorry.” Nadia then left Gretchen to study, closing the door behind her. Meanwhile, Gretchen went to her bathroom and filled up the tub. She smiled to herself. She’d gotten $50,000 dollars and lost a tremendous amount of back pain, but also gained a pair of the most sensitive breasts. Gretchen’s breasts were impressive size wise, but she couldn’t climax from nipple stimulation alone like she could with Nadia’s.  “That girl needs to learn how to negotiate,” Gretchen said; settling into the tub, massaging her new breasts in the tub. Her dark brown nipples perked up at her touch.  “Maybe I should have majored in business?”",0.588904,0.0,0.791019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18326693227091634

c,"&gt;Is recovery possibly without surgery? The percentage of people with sciatica symptoms who recover without surgery is high, really high. &gt;How can I alleviate pain in the mean time? Mostly by avoiding positions or activities which cause inflammation.  Stretching may help, an NSAID like Mobic might help.  Eventually you may consider ESIs to reduce inflammation and buy yourself more time to recover without surgery. Sphinx pose, nerve flossing are a couple of examples of things a PT might have you do depending on what shows up on the imaging. &gt;Will I be able to Olympic lift again? It will probably be more of a question of whether or not it makes any sense to do Olympic lifts.  There are plenty of ways to keep/build your legs/posterior chain without Olympic lifts which are way safer for your spine.   You basically have a few cards you can play to avoid a lifetime of pain and Oxycontin.  Avoiding the first surgery...then after the first one (often a microdiscectomy) avoiding a possible second, then avoiding a Fusion.  It's a decision with high stakes and the workout world is huge, there are a million things you can do besides Olympic lifts.   I'll just be blunt, I can't think of something potentially more dangerous for a person's spine healthy or not than Olympic lifting in a Crossfit gym.   Overall advice: I'd find a spine hospital/clinic and make an appointment with a neuro or ortho surgeon.  Get the imaging done (xrays and MRI) then pursue conservative treatment as long as possible.  It's likely you have a herniated disk based on your age, activities and symptoms and herniated disks often heal on their own.  The imaging is important because it can identify other conditions that won't heal on their own.  Use the spine clinic's PTs.   Recovery could be anywhere for a few weeks to years.  Whether or not surgery is appropriate and when to pull the trigger is really situational and depends on a lot of factors.  In the case of a herniated disk it is a balance between your odds of recovery without surgery and the odds of nerve damage if you continue conservative treatment.  Estimating those two variables is something for you and a surgeon to do at any given point.  Good luck!!        ",0.551162,0.596881,0.956193,0.803465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2413793103448276
s,"Not sure if this belongs here or in /r/meditation, but ok a little bit of back story, for the past year I've been experimenting with psychedelic drugs, and they've helped me to improve my life in a significant way, I'm much happier, less self conscious, and have no more irrational fears, and I've learned a lot about how everything in this world is intertwined and connected, and at points I've experienced ego death. But after taking a break from them I've realised that psychedelics haven't been teaching me or showing me anything new for quite some time now and I don't feel a need to take them any more. But I am very interested in learning more about Buddhism and meditation. I've started practising meditation with no expectations about what's going to happen, I just clear my mind and focus on my breathing. I have a few questions about a few things I've come across while learning about buddhism and ego death. What exactly is sila, samadhi and prajna? I have a vague idea but don't fully understand, and why are they important to focus on before ego death? Because I've experienced ego death through the use of psychedelics would reaching ego death through meditation be the same experience? Do people get visual distortions and geometric patterns while meditating similar or the same as the ones experienced while on a psychedelic drug? While meditating I focus on my breathing and nothing else, but when a thought pops into my head, what do I then do? Do I brush it off then carry on focusing on my breathing, or if I feel the thought is important enough to think about, do I let it become a run away thought and think about it for a while then continue with focusing on my breathing?

s,"  This past weekend, I experienced one Helluva drug and now Im an addict; Master made me feel exposed, vulnerable, and submissive beyond anything I have experienced before.  It was my first time ever in lingerie and I met him last Saturday at 4am. For a little bit we just sat and talked, as I subtly rubbed my arms against his and stayed close to him as possible as we sit in the dark and talk about all sorts of things. After a while, he had me remove my clothes to reveal the lingerie and he saw my body for the first time. He examined every part of me like a doctor, with pristine observation skills. He figured out I have Osteoporosis as well as a fractured wrist, very high arch heels (he knew that from my walking patterns), and he saw the scars from my Rosatia.      Master gave me a full-on exam and told me that he was going to help me with my back problems. He stood up and grabbed me by the neck tightly with 1 hand, and put his other hand under my chin flat for my underside to sit on. He looked at me with dead serious eyes and talked in a stern voice. He told me I was going to be doing squats every day to help shape my Butt which would help alleviate some of the back pain due to osteoporosis. He told me I would do 2 sets of 10 squats a day and check in with him every time I did them.   I was overcome with a familiar, yet strange sensation. There are times I have been made to feel submissive, to have individual will power just fleet away from me; but this was so much stronger. To me submission is a drug, and Master showed me the feelings I once compared to ecstasy were little more than a buzz. Master gave me a small taste of what submission can feel like. As I stand there helpless, he lightly chokes me as he demands a response from me acknowledging his authority. I just barely manage to muster “Yes Master” I was in shock and awe, I felt like I had died and gone to Heaven and was no longer of this Earth. He reminded me of my place, and that I have no choice but to obey his command.  After he let me go he commanded me to grab the plug he had me get to train me. He had me turn around and bend over as he slowly and gently put it in using tons of lube. Once it was in he pulled my panties back up and had me sit on his lap. He spread his legs apart and I sat on a napkin on his left pant leg with my legs resting on the open space between his legs. He wrapped his arms around me and drew me closer to him. We embraced and we made out for just a couple of minutes. In this time I was so overwhelmed from everything, I was so passive and submissive he could have done anything he wanted to me and I wouldn’t not have fought back.

s,"Hi -I am searching for answers.  I've had blood in my urine off and on for about a year.  I was examined fully 8 months ago (CT Scan, cystoscopy, urine tests) and the only thing of note that the doctor found was a mildly enlarged prostate, which he theorized may be pushing into my bladder and causing blood.  Also found was a 4mm kidney stone, which was deemed to be unobstructing and not a cause of the blood.  Lately I've been having blood again.  I've noticed that I do have some soreness in my perineal area, and slight burning when i pee.  I've also had soreness in my piriformis muscle for a couple years now.    I've also noticed that after I ride my bike for 8 miles home from work, I often have episodes where I have some abdominal/back pain followed by a bloody pee.  Does any of this sound like it could be prostatitis?  I'm not sure how much blood in the urine is a symptom of it.  I was suspicious of the kidney stone, however it has not been THAT painful.  thanks for your help/advice",0.0,0.575037,0.896922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3315508021390374
c,"I've got a bad back - no injury and no disc involvement, just weakness from years of sitting hunched over computers. I'm also generally very weak &amp; overweight - not massively but I could lose a couple of stone. Over the last few years I've tried stretches, running, cycling, all of which aggrivates my back immediately and in most causes causes it to ""go"", causing me weeks or months of pain. Over the last 2 weeks, I've started a very simple bodyweight core routine as soon as I get up in the morning and the effect has been nothing short of profound. I do: * 10x Cat Cow stretches * 5x Cobra stretches * 20x Bridges * 20x Dead Bugs (10 each side) * 20x Bird Dogs (10 each side) * 60s Front plank * 30s Side plank each side * 20x Leg swings on each side (front to back) * 60s Sitting hamstring stretch * 60s Couch stretch on each leg I find the workout to be absolutely brutal, but in the last two weeks my back pain has been significantly reduced for the first time in years - this affirms to me that my back pain is down to weak core muscles, shortened leg/hip muscles and also really affirms that I am very weak... no wonder my back keeps ""going"". I'm planning on getting a good full month of this workout in before I make additions to it, but I'd like advice on wether the following would be a good idea to do AFTER the above each morning: 3 Sets of: * 10x Pushups (or as many as I can first manage) * 10x Inverted Rows using a dip bar (or as many as I can first manage) * 10x Squats (or as many as I can manage) * 10x Romanian deadlifts (each side, or as many as I can manage) I'd like to do these as a superset, with minimal rest between them. Time is a premium and I like that the intensity really gets my heart going and my sweat on. Doing the above, I feel like I'll be getting a very comprehensive full body work out that I can practice and improve upon over the next 3 to 6 months before upping the progressions.

s,"For basically my entire life since I discovered video games, I've had bad posture. Slouched back, text neck, forward hunched shoulders (this was due to being a competitive swimmer actually). These issues with posture have given me (tolerable) neck and back pain for the last 6-7 years now.Recently I came into some VERY good quality MDA, so I decided what the hell and dropped 70mg last night. After about 2 hours or so I knew I was close to peaking, so I busted out a new box of nitrous.My usual routine before I take a nos balloon is to take a dab (not every time, just before the first one), so I did, then I loaded up my balloon.Recently I've been VERY into meditation, and I actually haven't taken any substances besides some shitty LSA since last September or so. So I've genuinely been feeling a lot more in tune with my body than usual.Anyway, I sucked in the balloon, and the familiar wubwubwubwub started happening. But then something I'd never felt before came up. It was this severely uncomfortable feeling in my neck, right where my problem area is the worst.Then my body just kind of took over and sort of self-righted. It felt like my neck unlocked. I felt this tremendous wave of energy rush through my body and the uncomfortable feeling immediately vanished.So with my first words I asked my girlfriend to look at my posture. Sure enough, she told me I was sitting perfectly upright.I feel so grateful to have discovered this, because now I can actively stay mindful to my neck positioning and hopefully improve my overall quality of life!So in conclusion, I have meditation, MDA, Nitrous oxide, and marijuana to thank for fixing my posture!",0.677593,0.616009,0.827758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26804123711340205
s,"Hello all,For the record, I am currently overweight (obviously). This isn't my first weight-loss rodeo, but I'm usually more of a cardio person... Still, I recognize the value of working different muscles groups, so I've been trying really hard to get into more aerobic-type stuff. There's a youtube channel in particular that has a lot of great videos for beginners that I use a lot.Unfortunately a lot of it involves floor exercises (crunches, chest flys, etc...) and I have an awful time with these. I do have a hardwood floor but I bought an extra cushy yoga mat for this purpose. Yet I still find that anytime I have to lift my shoulders and/or legs off the ground, it makes my lower back feel bruised, right around the waistband of my pants. Almost like I have a bar digging into my skin, not really a muscle pain. Using a pillow under the area seems to alleviate it somewhat but not entirely, and then I feel like it messes up my form so I'm not really benefiting from the exercise. I've also tried adjusting my waistband in case that was the culprit but it seems to make no difference. It's literally just the floor making contact with my back in any way.Any advice for dealing with this? Is there some magic pillow for this? Does it get better or worse with weight-loss?

She has had two back surgeries and still suffers from back pain, the last few months has been hard and had to miss work, she needs help with medical bills. Please read her story and share Hello, my name is Amanda.. I am 25 years old. I am a full time worker and student. I have worked hard my whole life so far. So far I have had two spinal fusion surgeries for scoliosis, which greatly disrupts my life occasionally. I am used to a certain amount of pain and discomfort, but lately it has gotten significantly worse. When I went to the doctor they found a cyst where a lot of my nerve damage from my surgeries is near my spine and shoulder blade. I have been placed on a medical leave due to not being able to stay awake very well, getting dizzy to the point that I need to lay flat, and feeling like I am being tazed all day long from muscle spasms. I am not supposed to use my right arm for 3-4 weeks (which is my dominant hand/arm), and my doctor has been trying for months to get me to go on this two month medical leave. I can not afford it, but now I have no choice. I have already missed quite a bit of work on and off due to not being able to drive, stay awake, sit for long periods, trouble walking, and excruciating pain (I am a auto vehicle repair receptionist so you see the problem) that causes numbness, sharp pains, migraines and muscle tension all across my back, shoulder and neck. I do not want to lose my home and transportation due to this issue. I really do not like asking for help, but I have nothing else to sell and no where else to turn at this point.

Clinics are almost never open on weekends or after business hours because the government won't pay the extra fees which would encourage doctors and nurses to work off-hours.

I can't even get a prescription for pain pills because my Dr. requires me to come in so he can do what exactly? Look at my back? It doesn't look like anything. He knows I have ongoing back issues. Whatever. I had to wait until I could at least move a little and then someone drove me to ER, where I waited for hours to see someone. Then a couple of months later I sprained my ankle. Now what? No clinics. Dr.'s assistant says come in eight days. Eight days? How do I know if it's broken?! Had to go to ER. Wait more hours to see a Dr. and get Xrays. Got a grade 2 sprain.

I’ve also been in the process of losing weight via diet and strength training for several months now. Last Tuesday I came back from work and went for a mile run, except this time I decided to try some yoga poses beforehand instead of my normal stretches. They were definitely tough for me to do but I didn’t feel like I overdid any of it. Run went same as normal besides being a particularly hot day. I come back home and hydrate like normal. I’ve been wanting to change my sleep schedule for a few days to get up earlier so I took a melatonin and went to bed early. Next morning I wake up with the worst ache in my neck, upper back, and shoulders. It also hurt my eyes to move my head and my range of motion was very limited. I also had chills, fever, and was in a stupor because of lightheadedness and fatigue. I took Tylenol that night and nothing happened. Next day symptoms got worse so I went to urgent care. I did have a fever of 102. Nurse there gave me Flu and Covid tests (even though I’m fully vaccinated plus 2 months), both negative. All she could attribute it to was a virus of some sort, even though I’ve had no diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, respiratory issues, cough, sneeze, etc. prescribed me 800mg Ibuprofen and that was that. Since then the Ibuprofen has been just enough to help me sleep and move my head with a bit less pain but I’d say it’s only helping about 30-40% and becoming less effective each day and causing me night sweats. It just doesn’t make sense to me that I would have a virus that exclusively gives me neck and back pain.

s,This is my first post sorry if it’s awful or in the wrong spot. BackstoryFor over a month I have had back pain. My doctors don’t fully know what it is but they think it’s muscle spasms. I have been given 2 different types of pain meds by my doctor. I have missed a lot of school due to the pain. So given my limited ability to move I have a doctors note that says that I’m limited to low impact sports. I also am in physical therapy. Story I have a pe class that I have to take due to the law. There are around 60 kids in my class and I have two PE teachers a male and female. I had two doctors notes due to seeing my normal doctor and being in the ER. I had to give these notes to the attendance office. They would email my teacher. They did email my teacher and I had a few easy days. After five-six days both of my PE teachers decided that I should be fine and should participate in Soccer. Me having social anxiety and always being told that I should follow the command of every adult did as told. This went very wrong. By the end of the class period I was almost in tears by the amount of pain that I was in. I couldn’t really go home early due to the fact that I had a physical therapy appointment. So I toughened it out for the rest of the day. The second I walked into the healthcare office my physical therapist knew something happened. She told me that low impact is basically walking and I should try to push myself farther than that unless it’s with her so she can tell if something is going wrong. I missed school the day after the event due to the pain that I was in. Now I have to go to school and try to explain the situation to my PE teachers without having a panic attack or getting sent to the deans office. Wish me luck I’m sorry if this was awful I just wanted to ask someone if I’m in the wrong and should just toughen up.

s,"Hi! This post is about my partner (does not have reddit but was hoping to get some advice as we are at our wits end). He is 53 years old, 253 lbs, Caucasian male of Eastern European descent, 6’0 and we are currently visiting the Mayo Clinic. No smoking, no recreational drugs, no alcohol in the last year. Background on him, before the health issues, extremely fit for an older male that went to the gym regularly 5-6 days a week, a masters in exercise medicine, owned a chain of fitness centers, director for wellness center for Florida Hospital, and maintained an average weight of 200 lbs from his 20s up until he became sick with this unknown illness (52). He maintained a healthy diet, normally low carbs, high protein, less than 2 sodas a day, does not smoke, socially drinks, and no recreational drugs: No excessive caffeine as well. Last October he was recommended by general physician and a GI surgeon to have his gall bladder removed due to extreme number of gall stones. Before the surgery he had lower back issues, trouble walking long durations, and sleep issues. He described the pain as familiar to passing a kidney stone. The surgeon recommended a laparoscopic surgery and we agreed. During the surgery, the surgeon told me that it went perfect and I should be allowed to see him after 30 minutes as soon as he is awake and responsive. An hour and a half passes, I ask the attendant if I can see him and they let me in to hearing him screaming from pain from the surgery. They said he woke up earlier than expected and cannot be given any sedatives since it could affect his health. We were told the air trapped in his body would take at least 10 days to leave his body but once it is gone the swelling should go down rather quickly. Three weeks after the surgery we schedule another meeting for a follow up mainly to see why there had been an increase in swelling instead of a decrease. The surgeon said this happens and it could take up to 6 months for the swelling to fully disappear and if anything persists talk back to the family doctor. 5 months in the swelling has only gotten worse, his weight has increased by about 30 lbs and he can no longer exercise, eat, or sleep (even drinking water causes extreme pain in the abdomen). We visit the primary care doctor weekly now about the pain and possible solutions and treatments. Blood work is pristine, no auto immune diseases, no parasites, no elevated white blood cells, tested negative for fungal and bacterial diseases. Even Quest Diagnostic was stumped at how healthy his blood is yet there is no answer. Primary doctor recommended us now to a Gastrointestinal Specialist. Going to the GI was hopeful but gave no answers, tested negative on microbacterial tests, endoscopy came back back perfect (very minuscule acid reflux damage) and biopsies all came back negative. The intestine look healthy and are not inflamed and they have examined him with multiple CTs with and without contrast.   The doctor recommended s colonoscopy but they believe it is not a gastrointestinal issue even though there is extreme bloating in the abdomen. Recommended seeing a Neuro and Cardio specialist who all found nothing after multiple visits. Exhausted from seeing multiple specialists weeks apart, we were referred to the Mayo Clinic by family. After living with 10 months with these symptoms we finally get our first consult and were immediately scheduled in a flurry of appointments. All the blood work, urine tests, and x days are coming back healthy which leads our general doctor to believe it might be the Nervous system. The long term damage of the symptoms have caused other issues such as: -sleep apnea (they believe the pressure in his abdomen is stopping his lungs from fully expanding when he lays down. His oxygen intake is currently at a 62%)-arthritis-lethargy-anxiety-depression-sciatica -memory loss -insomnia These issues are all building up now and making life extremely difficult. His current eight has increased to 253 lbs in just 10 months and now needs a cane to move around. The doctor is waiting for results from the rheumatology expert and the colonoscopy before moving forward with any other possible solutions. They also are holding for the sleep study to come back and to see if a C pap machine would be helpful to get him to sleep. Now we are doing all this research at home while waiting for the results to see if an overly exhausted sympathetic nervous system could be the cause of these symptoms? Does anyone have any advice or experiences in these situations? Any advice would be greatly appreciated so that we can be a little more informed when we are discussing an action plan with our doctors on our next visit back to the clinic.

For context, I (26F) was born with unfortunately large  breasts. currently my bra size is that of a whopping 38 E. Because of this, ive had INTENSE back pain, shoulder pain, etc growing up.

Ive tried yoga, stretching, exercising, and everything to try to eliminate back pain (i hoped that with a stronger core or something I'd be able to support my own chest), buy I've only found that it makes it worse.So i did some research and found that a breast reduction was just what i needed- I thought about going down to a C cup or even a B.

So, about a week ago, I brought up with my boyfriend (28M), thinking he'd take it well (he's always been supportive of me, so i trusted him) and he was PISSED.

We argued about it for a good 2 hours before he tried to ""compromise"" with me and say he was alright with it as long as i didnt go below a D cup, because anything smaller than that was ""childish"". He also called me egotistical and self absorbed, asking me why i didnt talk to him about it sooner, or think he would care about it. I told him I didnt think he'd care so much about me changing MY body, and he stormed out of the room and has been passive aggressively ignoring me ever since, even to the extent that he wont say i love you back, or sleep in the same bed as me.

s,"This is a rather delayed birth story as my son is now coming up on 19 months but I figured I would write it while waiting for his brother to decide to come out. Currently at 38+4.On the Wednesday when I was 40+4 I had my midwife appointment and she gave me a membrane sweep. This wasn’t very uncomfortable and I’d do anything to get labour going at this point so I was happy to say yes when she offered it. (And I’m absolutely getting it again!)I believe it was later on the Wednesday or early on Thursday that I lost my mucus plug. Thursday I went out with my husband for lunch as he was working from home this week in anticipation of our sons hopefully soon arrival. In the evening, I’m guessing 9pm I noticed I had back pain that seemed to come and go so I timed it in case this was what contractions felt like. No pain round my tummy just the back. After a while it got regular and we called the hospital for advice. They told us to stay home still until it got closer and basically more uncomfortable.I went for a bath for a while and was watching something on my tablet to distract me. Was a bit of a relief being in the tub. Once I got out I told my husband we should head to the hospital and I got my hospital bag and got dressed. Trip was about 15-20 minutes and we got there just about midnight. The contractions in my back were pretty uncomfortable at this point so we had to stop often on the walk in just so I could lean on my husband during the contractions. It was a pretty busy night at the labour ward so we waited a short while and then they took me to a room in the post-natal ward as there were no rooms available in the delivery ward.Shortly after I went to the birthing tub and husband says we probably spent about an hour in there. Not actually in the tub the whole time mind you cause at this point I was so warm and uncomfortable that I spent at least half of the time crying cause I wanted to be in the tub but it was too warm to be in it for long. Hormones and tiredness had certainly kicked in.We went back to the room and I got a hospital gown and they took me in a wheelchair to the delivery room.I got some paracetamol or similar at this point and was super awkward about swallowing them. I hate swallowing pills at normal times and I was not exactly being very sensible at this time. Eventually got them down but shortly after they came back up when I had to run to the bathroom to vomit. I believe I ended up throwing up twice that night. I was on my back for the rest of the time because the back pain was too much for me to be in any other position. I was also mostly naked for the whole thing cause it was just too warm for any coverings. Husband says they tried to cover me up one time but I just tore it right off again. He also says they checked my cervix to see how dialated I was but I have no recollection of either of these two things.I got offered the gas and air (as requested in my birth plan) and after another while of my being awkward about using it I finally got it used and it was helpful though I didn’t like the initial feeling of dizziness. Around 4 maybe husband thought that he could sneak 5 min of rest on the sofa in my room but I called him to stand up where I could smell him. Was incredibly calming for me.At this point the midwife was just sitting in the corner and at some point said that if I felt the need to push I should just go for it. Wasn’t long after that I started pushing. My waters didn’t actually break until I started pushing so it came out like an explosion! Think i must have pushed for 3 maybe 4 contractions before he was out. Wasn’t long anyway. I remember saying “his head is right there!” after one of the contractions where I couldn’t quite get him out but he then came on the next push. He was born at 5 am on the Friday when I was 40+6.I got him placed on my chest and the placenta came out without any bother. Husband cut the cord. He was sunny side up so I have later realised that explained the contractions in my back. I did tear but no idea to what degree. They had to get a doctor in to stitch it up though as it was opposite angle to normal.I had to spend 3 days in the hospital while we figured out breastfeeding but we got it eventually and breastfed exclusively until he was 11 months old. Those 3 days were HARD though. I just wanted my poor baby to eat and with the lack of sleep and hormone dump I was ready to cry at a moments notice. It was a shared room for 4 and it was very disheartening to see everyone get sent home after a couple of hours because they had chosen to formula feed.

c,"The reason his pain management dr won't write him any scripts is because he's getting these injections in his back. They are doing trial and errors to see which ones work. But, none of them have and they still refuse to give him anything. They won't even prescribe him anti-inflammatory meds while he's getting the shots. And yeah, it definitely is hard to find a good dr. Every single one that we've seen has done nothing to address the pain. They're brushing him off like he's just trying to get pain meds. Which isn't the case. He wants a long term fix (like surgery) but they ignore his requests. It's sad. We've yet to find a good dr that will actually listen to him without judgement. And we will do that! Thanks for that advice. I'm completely overwhelmed with all this information, but I'm taking notes so that he can hopefully find something that actually works.  We have a couple of different scales already, for um.. other reasons. lol. And my mom has a pocket sized one because she grows and dries her own herbs and sometimes will buy bulk supplements and just capsule them herself.  I watch him like a hawk with anything medicinal. lol. Like I said in another comment, we already have 2 kids and sometimes he's like the 3rd one. I'm very ehh about him taking medicines when I'm not around. But I know that if he has so many on him, he will try to stretch them. So I will probably give him only so much of something and then lock the rest away until it's time for another dose or I can watch him. It sounds bad, but I know his past, and I don't want him to overdo it on anything. I just worry a little too much ): Thank you! And I will! You all are so awesome for being so informative.

c,"Besides not stating the source, I'm  ok with the basement dwellers jacking to porn. Like you said survival of the fittest. At any rate they are probably people that no one wants to have sex with anyway. .   ## Benefits of masturbation Masturbation is a healthy sexual activity. It has many benefits for your physical and mental health.  There are limited studies on the benefits of masturbation, but there are studies on sexual intercourse and stimulation.  Research and anecdotal reports suggest that sexual stimulation, including stimulation through masturbation, may help you: * relieve built-up stress * sleep better * boost your mood * relax * feel pleasure * relieve cramps * release sexual tension * have better sex * better understand your wants and needs   ## Masturbation and prostate cancer Some research suggests that regular ejaculation may lower the risk of [prostate cancer](https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-cancer), though doctors aren’t exactly sure why.  A  2016 study found the risk of prostate cancer decreased by about 20  percent in men who ejaculated at least 21 times a month. A 2003 study  also discovered a similar link between frequent ejaculation and lower  prostate cancer risk.  There’s no evidence, though, that ejaculating regularly protects against advanced prostate cancer.   ## Masturbation during pregnancy Hormone changes during pregnancy cause  some pregnant women to feel heightened sexual desire. Masturbation is a  safe way to release sexual tension during pregnancy.  Self-pleasure may also help ease pregnancy symptoms, such as lower back pain. You may feel mild, irregular cramping, or [Braxton-Hicks contractions](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/braxton-hicks-contractions-vs-real-contractions), during and after orgasm.  They  should fade away. If the contractions don’t disappear and become more  painful and frequent, contact your doctor right away.  Masturbation may not be safe for women with high-risk pregnancies. This is because orgasm can increase your chances of labor.   ## Takeaway Masturbation is a healthy, natural, and safe way to practice self-care and improve your health. Masturbating  may have many benefits for your mind and body. Despite the possibility  of addiction, there are no harmful side effects.  Feel free to  enjoy self-pleasure without guilt or shame.

Not sure if it’s external, internal, prolapse or all of them. I had it a couple times pre-preggo but it never got this bad. Whenever I think it’s getting better, it gets worse again the next day, it is so discouraging. I can’t believe I spent my new year agonizing over my butthole. I’m taking metamucil and miralax so I’m pooping normal again this past couple days, no more straining. But the itch just WONT GO AWAY. It’s 2021, I just want my butthole to be normal again. Talk about the things you take for granted. - Tucks pads (50% witch hazel) doesn’t work - Prep H cream doesn’t work- Prep H suppository seems to be working but it only works for 4 hours max - Tucks 5% lidocaine cream works for the itchiness but has to reapply often / all depends on how severe the swelling is - Sitz bath, just ordered one online and will get it on Sunday. Pharmacist friend said adding baking soda would help with the itchiness. Has anyone tried it??- 1% Hydrocortisone cream, gonna ask my OB if it’s safe to use. - Ice compress: it works!!!!

Baby's due date was March 19 and I had begun to feel intense back pain after leaving school one afternoon. I thought it was a kidney stone, so we went to the hospital where they sent us up to labor and delivery. They hooked me up to monitors and the nurse came in and asked if I was having the pain right then. Through gritted teeth, I replied yes. She said, ""honey, you are having contractions every 5-6 minutes!"" Oh, okay. Shit. They pumped me full of IV fluids and tributelene. The contractions stopped but they kept me over night. Found out I was dilated to 1 1/2 cent and 60% effaced. I was in shock. The doctor ordered strict bed rest and steroids shots for the baby, as well as the antibiotics for group b.We were discharged and I spent the next few days lounging in bed. We then had our two baby showers back-to-back that weekend. Sat the entire time.Monday of this past week rolls around and I'm feeling off. Contractions coming every 20-30 minutes, but mild and nothing regular. On Tuesday morning at 2:30a my water broke. Baby was only 34 weeks 5 days.Labor was 9 hours from water break to birth. I got my epidural pretty quickly, after about 6 hours of labor. Went from 6-10 centimeters in about an hour. I pushed for 24 minutes and tore in two places. James Harrison was born 2/10/15 at 11:19 pm, weighing a whopping 6 lbs 12 oz! Wtf! He would have been 10 lbs easily, had he gone full term. He had an 8 and 9 APGAR score, lungs were fine.The rest of our adventure has been the difficult part. I'm not trying to scare anyone, but baby had to be put in NICU. His blood sugar levels were well below where they needed to be, he was eating very well, and his oxygen levels went into desats (fell below levels) in the first two nights. Every day he's improving and he's supposed to be coming home today! I'm terrified and happy and scared and anxious; hormones have had me crying almost daily. But I'm sure we will get the hang of it.

s,"Hi all,I'm 23F in the UK and was diagnosed with sciatica by multiple chiropractors nearly 2 years ago during university. Nothing helped, no PT, no chiro, no painkillers. The only thing that managed my pain was working out when I could and maintaining a good muscle mass. Because of this they thought I had a piriformis problem.Fast forward to now. About 3 months ago I started having pain so badly I would be throwing up and nearly passing out. My partner had to hold onto me when I even tried to move in bed because I'd end up crying and I have a pretty high pain threshold. We were travelling at the time and I was so bad that I was given a wheelchair in the airports because I kept nearly passing out.When we returned home I booked a doctors appointment which was 2 weeks away at the earliest. When I went of course the pain had subsided and I was walking almost normally again. My doctor scoffed at the fact that chiropractors diagnosed it and wrote down in the notes 'lower back pain' and nothing else. He said he'd put a referral in for PT as they won't do an MRI that I had requested until that was done.It's now nearly two months later and the pain is back as bad as ever. I've got a job as a waitress meaning there's no way I can go to work like this, hell I just nearly passed out going to the toilet 5ft from the bed. So at 1:30am and not being able to sleep I decided I'm going into the doctor tomorrow even if I have to crawl, demand a note for work and demand they refer me for an MRI, I can't live like this anymore.My question for you guys is has anyone with piriformis syndrome had pain this bad or does it sound more sinister? I just want to know the cause to know how to stop this.For reference:- no over the counter painkillers help- stretches and yoga is impossible while in pain so doesn't help- it's worse when I'm sat down for long periods of time- it mostly affects my right side but during the hell 3 months ago that lasted over a month, it switched from left to right then both sides at the same time- multiple chiropractors have said I have problems in my lower spine and pelvis where my joints don't move as they should, don't know if this is a factorSorry for the wall of text, thanks if you got this far!TLDR: I'm desperate for an MRI but my doctor won't give me one.

c,"I'm a woman. I had scoliosis from age 8 till age 13. My top curve progressed to more than 70 degrees (X-ray of my spine http://imgur.com/FeA23Rl - I also gained a couple inches. 4'11 to 5'1.75 YAY lol) at the time of surgery. I felt comfortable doing gym class and sports again around 8 months after the surgery. Im 19 now (6 years post op) and I don't powerlift but I am able to lift heavy. I don't experience back pain unless I do something with bad form. Also I have some muscle imbalances - one of my shoulders and hips are higher than the other - and it can cause a little pain sometimes but nothing terrible or technically caused by moving weight. If anything, having the rod actually helps with my deadlifting and other lifts because it forces me to keep good, straight posture.  But you are older now, and any major surgery is going to take some time to recover from, especially something like a spinal fusion. I wasn't fully healed until a year post op. I have a bit of a flexibility issue I guess like I won't be doing back bends well anytime soon but nothing that has affected my lifts. I think it helps that my surgeon left my lumbar spine alone to straighten itself back out and he didn't put the rod all the way up my neck lol.  ANYWAYS I would suggest seeing surgeons and talking to them about it and letting them know your goals and see if you can find a surgeon willing to work with you!

s,"Hi,About four months ago my wife, 30, underwent a breast reduction in order to alleviate her chronic back pain. In this sense the operation was a success, she has her life back (as much as we can, thanks to Covid). It is a revelation to her to be mostly free from pain.Before the operation she was generally very body-positive. We all have our proverbial sore spots, but in general she was very confident both in herself, and with her appearance. Her breasts were her 'best feature', and she enjoyed having a large cup size (until the pain became unmanageable). We had a 'boob funeral' before the Op, which was great fun.Her relationship with her breasts has changed dramatically. She is mostly happy with the size and shape, but not with the appearance of the nipples. Part of the procedure was moving the nipples further up the breast, so there is quite thick scar tissue around them, some asymmetry, and one of the nipples is slightly distorted.We talk about how she's doing regularly. A lot of that was just reassurance that she's still healing so things will change, and that everything does seem to be healing fine and I don't think her nipple is going to fall off, but at the 4 month mark now it's clear that the way they look now will more-or-less be the way there are from now on.As I said in the title, she told me she doesn't feel feminine anymore, and that het breasts just 'feel like meat, hanging off her.'

c,"I’ve been through two Full IVf cycles and three transfers, so lots of ultrasounds. All clear. Also two clear HSGs. I just had a lap in December that found endometriosis (technically stage three because of small endometriomas, but otherwise few spots). I’ve had three failed embryo transfers, which was why my doctor pushed for the lap. A lap is the only definitive way to diagnose endo, but other things can lead you to suspect it- I suspected it based on my poor IVf response, ‘brown gunk’ aspirated out of ‘follicles’ during retrieval, declining amh, low testosterone, and cyclical back pain.  We went to IVf initially due to MFI. I’ve never had a chance at a free sex baby. If you’re able to have intercourse, a lap (treating, not just diagnostic) has shown to improve pregnacy rates in people with endo. If you’re proceeding to IVf, it could affect your fertility (if the endo is on your ovaries, removing it could cause harm) and it’s not recommended. It’s thought IVf can bypass a lot of problems caused by endo, but not in all people. I agreed to the lap, knowing it may impair my ability to do IVf in the future with my own eggs because I’m open to using donor gamates.  Long story short- if you’re able to have sex to have a baby (no MFI) a lap may be beneficial. If you’re pursuing IVF, it probably will not be, except to guide future protocols. You could always do a retrieval, then look for/chemically Treat endo after (ex with the receptivaDx biopsy, which is showing some promise at looming for endo, although a lot of docs don’t believe it it yet due to limited study data) although that doesn’t address any damage endo may/may not due to eggs before retrieval.  As you can see, know one really knows how endo affects fertility or how best to treat it.  As for treating pain, there’s no guarantee removing endo will treat your pain. It may, but pain nerves could be so chronically stimulated that removing the endo won’t help. Until you do it, you won’t know. There’s a chance of you don’t remove it all, you could make the endo worse, so research your surgeon carefully.

Its happened several times before now that plans are made or we plan a day to go to the grocery store and boom! Sudden tummy ache, headache, backache, shoulderache, neckache. Responsibilty arrives and so does every kind of ache you could have. The last big ""tummy ache"" we had was on Easter Sunday. I had been cleaning our house like a madman the week leading up and had woken up early to finish up the cleaning and make sure myself and my daughter were all dressed and ready (he throws a tantrum and treats everyone like shit anytime he has to wake up before noon for anything on the weekend so I was used to being on my own to get everything ready). Now, the night before I asked him ""We all planned to start Easter at noon tommorow? Are you sure you can do it?"" And He reassures me that he will be joing us for lunch. Well 10:00 easter morning i go in our room and give his shoulder a little shake and let him know what time it is (seeing as how he stayed up until 2 in the morning playing games and never set any alarms on his phone) he gives me the usual ""stop. Fuck off."" Thats his version of a 'snooze' button. I try again at 10:30 and 11:00 and same thing. Then HIS family starts to arrive. His parents and grandma are in our living room playing with our daughter and enjoying the holiday so i go try to wake him up again. This is when he decides to mention he's got an upset stomach, a headache, and a backache. Grrrreeeaaat. I go downstairs to tell everyone he probably wont be joining us and of course right away his grandma says ""well he was sick last time we tried to go out too."" I fucking know Connie because ""last time"" was my birthday dinner and yes he stayed home from that too. He woke up around 2 o clock and made it just in time to watch OUR daughter hunt for easter eggs but because he ""isn't a morning person"" he was rude as fuck to me. Id ask him something or try to talk to him and he would completely ignore me. It took a another whole hour before he would talk to me. By then everyone was gone, i had just put our daughter down for a nap, and was cleaning up by myself. He asked me where I had hidden his weed so his family wouldnt see. He didnt apologize and only told me his tummy still hurts but hes feeling alright enough to drive himself to get cigarettes. Ive tried to get him to go to a doctor several times but he refuses.

It probably does have that same type of effect in some way.  I guess I just an worried that even though you say, and I'm sure think is true that your ""only continuous draw to them (opiates) is to alleviate my damn back pain."" I'm worried that deep down it is not. You say the back pain is related to work? Is there any way that you could work in a way that doesn't create more injury to your back? You may want to actually change jobs rather than risk an addiction and/or sensitize your pain into it being worse than if you never took a painkiller. It also sensitizes you to all pain, don't quote me on this but I think it started when they noticed patients on long term opiates/opioids reacted much more strongly to things that should not be that painful, I think it was maybe getting some type of shot or I.V. being put in. But, for whatever reason, people on long term use feel more pain than others who have to deal with the same exact painful stimuli. Listen, I only know this because of the draw for me to opiates. I started out working a job I loved and was moving up quickly into my absolute dream job, but my migraines and headaches were getting worse and worse and I knew I could not keep going out sick so I started with Percocet (after many failures of other non narcotic drugs) but of course I started to love the Percocet even when I didn't have a migraine, and the spiral goes from there.  Ended up losing out on on my dream job, fighting an opiate addiction and now I'm not working at all and the headaches are even worse.

s,"Let me first start off by saying I think I've read every thread in this sub 10 times :) Mattress shopping legitimately sucks. Let me also apologize for the length of this post, I'm putting as much information down as I can for those folks who might come here in the future looking for advice. I split it into chapters for easy reference lol.* **A little bit about the sleepers:**I'm 6 foot 220 lbs. I tend to fall asleep on my back and wake up on my stomach. I also fall asleep on my side on occasion.My wife is 5'2 130lbs, she falls asleep on her back but usually ends up on her side.Overall, I feel like we're both not picky sleepers. We've both been happy enough on a $600 mattress for 7 years and we don't have a lot of ""Must Have"" items when it came to our shopping choices.The only thing I feel like I don't want is a straight up foam/latex/gel/whatever mattress without an innerspring. The feeling is just too different and I feel like I'm not sleeping on a bed, more so a hammoc/couch/jello combination. That being said, I'd still be open to buying one if someone could sell me on it.* **What I'm looking for:**I think I'm shooting for a medium firm mattress because everything feels good at the mattress store except the pillow tops which feel like they lack support.I'm just now getting rid of my 8 year old Kingsdown innerspring pillow top. It was a really good mattress in my opinion, the support just isn't there anymore and it's giving my wife and I back pains.My target is a split king (or 2 twin XL) with a split adjustable base. I've heard great things about the snore reduction of some of the smarter bases and my wife reads constantly so I think it will be a nice change for her.* **The top 3 of the beds I've researched:**I also decided that I was going to  buy something that might last  a little longer and might offer a little slower degradation. Naturally, my first stop was Tempurpedic, however I sleep hot, and the stories of people not being able to sleep has scared me away. I just can risk spending $7,000 on a mattress that I can't sleep on. The store felt fine for the 10 minutes I laid on it but then again, the conditions weren't the same as they would be at home. Plus, they're a little more than I wanted to spend.The next mattress I researched was the Saatva Solaire. The reason I am really drawn to this model is because the reviews seem to be relatively good as far as build quality and it seems like it's a generally good product. I also really like the idea of an air mattress that would offer me the option to change my firmness. I'm an avid bowler (at least I was before covid) and I'll often come home with lower back pain and the option of ratcheting up the firmness sounds like a great feature. The obvious downside to this mattress is the cost which tops out around $6,200 before tax. While that's more than I want to spend, I'm open to investing in a mattress that is built to last for a long time. Another GREAT addition is the top zips off for dry cleaning which is a feature I have always wanted in a mattress. I ALSO included the Saatva Classic.Next on the list was the Purple 3 hybrid. I chose this one because I thought it felt nice at the store, it's cheaper, it's different and lastly it's a flat top mattress so there wouldn't be a trench in between the two of us. The price came to about $4,600 before tax which is closer to what I wanted to spend for the kit. I don't really have a lot to say about the purple. I've read about them developing dips early on which is troubling, but every brand has those same reviews. They also gave me 10% off because my wife works at a hospital.My last option was to go DIY Latex Hybrid. This seems like a GREAT option in my case because I could literally buy all 3 kinds of firmness and mess with them individually.  I love the fact that you can take it all apart and replace anything that might deteriorate (relatively cheaply, too) as well as change the firmness by changing the layer order. A downside is, it's difficult to find someone who's gone through the experience of buying a mattress exactly like I'd like to build. I'd really like to find an out let that has someone with similar needs to mind saying ""I needed this, I bought this, and I spent this"" If anyone has such a link I'd very much appreciate it.* **Other mattresses I researched**I looked into a Sleep Number, but the cost, coupled with the general consensus that they leak, motors break, grow mold etc meant they were out of the running.I also looked into an iComfort but the cost savings wasn't enough to make me move over to Sealy VS a brand that has a little more history of good quality materials.All of the air mattresses got a run through, but cost, warranty, reviews, knocked each of them out for one reason or another.  Air mattresses are tough which is why I thought the Saatva was a good air mattress choice. I didn't see many mentions of motors going out or leaks.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I feel like this is all I can think of. I'm sure I'm missing something.

s,"Finally at 2 months and 99% healed! So my story is kinda long but I’ll shorten it so it isn’t too boring. **Pre-op** I was a 38GG (UK), and had been for about 5 years. I’m 24 years old. I was suffering with the usuals of having big boobs: depression, back pain, unable to do normal tasks and people staring CONSTANTLY. The final straw was when I was on the train home after a rubbish day in a super baggy jumper and I had this one man just stare at my chest and smile creepily. I went private as the wait for the NHS was around about 10 years and I never was approved via them. My surgery was £7,220 - I waited a month between consultation and surgery. **Post op**Weeks 1-3: i was send home with NO bra and NO bandages (that was the surgeons choice). I was never really *in pain*, but I did still take anti inflammatories because of the swelling. Within the first week I was washing my hair by myself. Week 4: THE WORST WEEK. A small hole opened up on the t-section and I thought it was going to get super infected and painful - it wasn’t but it was a pain to get dressing and cleaning twice a day. I had scabbing on my nipple and it became super itchy and was uncomfortable. The discharge stopped too! Yay. Weeks 5-8: nothing really happened during the weeks. My boobs have naturally dropped during week 6 and stopped being swollen. I have FULL feeling in my boobs except the nipples - they still get erect though so I know they’re working. Week 6 my t-section hole closed up but I did accidentally scrape the scab off my nipple and it bled. It’s still healing now (see picture). Just last week I started running again and lifting weights - I’m too scared to use my arms too much but I’m getting there. I’m SUPER happy with them. I’m having a call with my surgeon today and going to ask him about scar cream to use! I’m open to questions - sorry if it was brief but I have a terrible memory.

s,"I have been suffering with ongoing back pain which often bothers me during and after playing guitar.  I recently became aware of the existence of the double guitar strap.  The idea is that the strap goes across both shoulders to help balance the weight of the instrument more evenly, as opposed to the load being constantly on one shoulder, which over hundreds of hours of playing can lead to muscle/posture imbalance.From having a look online there seems to be a few options.  Each varying considerably in price.[Slinger straps harness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ySkCIuq5E) will cost me about £70 including delivery to get it to the UK for the 3 inch version.  [.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ySkCIuq5E)[Neotech support harness.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGr7eYFMxUU) costs £90 and seems a bit more heavy duty as it contains aluminium supports around the shoulders but maybe these are unnecessary.  Planet Waves guitar strap is considerably cheaper at around £20.  However unlike the other two this one doesn't come with a waist strap.  I'm assuming the waist strap is somewhat important as you would typically have a strap like this on hiking backpacks to try and take some of the weight off the wearers shoulders.At the minute I'm leaning towards the Slinger straps harness due to it's simplicity and potential ease of transport over the Neotech harness.  In my opinion they are both very expensive but maybe it's worth it if it means a healthier back and shoulders.Has anyone tried any of these double straps or any others for that matter and if so have you noticed much of a benefit to your back, neck or shoulders?",0.0,0.603495,0.934847,0.711308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28957528957528955
s,"Alright, first reddit post, I might as well share the story of the girl I knew freshman year of college. For this story, I'm going to call her ""Alice"", but that's not her real name for obvious privacy reasons. I'd also like to preface that while she came out as trans later on in the year and my telling of this story, that has nothing to do with my overall opinion of her. She clearly also had some definite mental health stuff going on and if for some reason she reads this, I want her to know that I really hope that she got some help and improved as a person since freshman year.To set the scene, I go to a private college that has a really good game design program and my freshmen dorm is pretty far away from most of the other freshmen dorm. Like most of the dorms on campus, this dorm is a renovated mansion, except mine was completely gutted, has no common room, and no elevator for my sorry disabled ass. However, because it's so cut off from the other dorms, a lot of us bonded pretty quickly. Especially the second and third floors. I'm not sure if it was on purpose or not, but a lot of the technology related majors were put in this dorm, so we had a lot in common. The floors were organized with gender-neutral/women on the first floor, men on the second floor, and the rest of the women on the tiny third floor. The basement was the home of the vending machine and the laundry stuff.So as we all bonded and we'd start hanging out and doing stuff as a group, Alice would be there too. At this point she wasn't out yet and she lived on the second floor with the guys. I feel bad for the roommate she had since he was a guy who basically lived in the stairwell all day and watched loli anime. When he wasn't watching his anime, he'd be taking one of his three daily showers that didn't affect his smell somehow and often flooded the second floor bathroom. Alice has dark blondish hair in the beginning if I remember correctly. She was a lot taller than me, but that doesn't mean much since I'm 5'2. She was a bit on the heavier side, but something very notable was the amount of grease on her that only increased as the year went on.The first sign of things to come was when Alice had her eyes on a girl on the third floor named Rose. She was the only one in a single on the floor and one of the two people on the floor to not be in a tech major. Despite Rose going out with someone at the time, Alice was infatuated with her. She kept pestering her over and over to go out on walks with her until Rose finally gave up just so Alice would stop asking.Rose wasn't into this walk at all and generally wasn't into Alice. She eventually noticed and then came the moment that's been immortalized in our friend group as an inside joke for years. Alice turns to Rose and says ""Were you a Debbie in your last life, because you're a real downer"".At this point Rose got fed up and left and shared the story with a bunch of us minus Alice. We all laughed at how stupid of a line that was, but we had no idea that it was going to lead to Alice starting to switch targets. I have no idea just how many girls were pursued, but I know it was a little bit before she got to me.Another important thing to mention was how my friend Caleb, who lived on the second floor and had one of the bigger rooms, basically turned his and his roommates' room into a makeshift common room. It was fun at first, but whenever Alice came in to get in on whatever we were doing, she'd be a bit of a creep. Like when we'd do a joke playthrough of Huniepop, she'd go non-stop about how much Nikki was her waifu and how we had to go for her gamer girl waifu. She'd get weirdly sexual with everyone in the room and brag about how much sex she totally had, much to everyone's annoyance. It'd reach a point when we did group hangouts we'd shut the door and visitors had to either knock quietly, or text the room owner to ask if we were all hanging out. It's been years so I don't remember exactly what Alice did at this point in the year to make us have to do it, but we all clearly thought this had to be done.At some point when it was starting to snow on campus, Alice began to ""court"" a girl I'll call Maya. She didn't live in our dorm, but she lived in a smaller dorm right behind ours that was converted from an old carriage house. This part is all second-hand so forgive me for being a bit vague here.Alice began to constantly try to go where ever Maya went until she told her to leave her alone. Alice kept doing these weird favors for her that Maya didn't ask for and at some point yelled at Alice to stop. She didn't take too kindly to this, so in the middle of the night, Alice went out into the parking lot between our dorms and in the snow, wrote out ""Go fuck yourself Maya"" right in front of Maya's window. Of course, this led to Alice getting a no contact order from campus security. Since Caleb also had his eyes on Maya and talked to her a lot, we all heard pretty fast.So now everyone was on super edge with Alice. It didn't help that she would sleep in the middle of the stairwell on some nights, making getting to morning classes a huge pain in the ass. She would also constantly hang out in the basement all day when she wasn't trying to get in on other peoples' business. This would make laundry awkward as shit, as she'd sit on top of the driers and you'd be socially obligated to say hi, which would of course prompt her to start talking about her waifus or some shit. It was so awful to the point where my laundry pile was growing to incredibly stupid sizes.One night at 2 in the morning, I was doing laundry because it's easier to pull an all nighter when there's extra incentive to stay awake. Of course, Alice is there on her laptop. She starts asking me about what kind of girls I like since I was super unsubtle about how gay I was around the dorm. I was super tired and didn't realize at first where she was taking it, so I answered honestly. Alice nodded along with me and she kept staring at me intensely. She then asked if I'd like to go out with her since we were both gay girl game designers. I declined, but she kept asking me and saying shit like ""there's no other gay girls in the game program"" and ""you're going to get fed up surrounded by straight guys all the time"". I kept declining and quickly got the rest of my laundry in before sprinting up to my room and telling my roommate about what happened.The next day, there's a post-it note on my door. From Alice. When I saw her name, my stomach dropped. I've dealt with a particularly terrible ""nice guy"" when I was in middle school/high school, so I was afraid of that shit repeating.The note was some kind of sob story about how no girl likes her because she's trans and how that she thought that I was a good enough person to understand her feelings, but she was wrong. It was pretty uncomfortable and I showed it to my roommate and a couple other girls on my floor who were all equally creeped out. I decided I should do something brave in my new adult life and confront Alice about why she makes other people uncomfortable.That convo basically went into a whole guilt trip thing similar to the note, but I eventually got out that her behavior made others' uncomfortable. She ended up storming off and the title of the post is about to kick in.From that point on, whenever my dormmates and I would hang out, we'd sometimes see feet standing on the other side of the door, listening to whatever we were talking about. She was out there listening to us. Now, of course we'd quiet down when we noticed her and when she'd notice that, she'd loudly punch the wall and run off. This happened multiple times to the point where someone as a joke put up a sign that read ""no punchies"". Alice didn't like that.The last incident with Alice that I remember was when we were doing a movie night in Caleb's room and I was up on the top bunk to watch, since I get bad back pain and needed something soft to lean on. When I climbed up there, Alice followed me and proceeded to inch closer and closer to me. There was plenty of room on the bed, but Alice kept moving her leg so it'd be in between mine. I didn't want to cause a scene since I already knew that Alice was prone to violent outbursts, so when I came back after a bathroom break, I sat next to Caleb on the floor not giving a shit about back pain.I wish there was some kind of grand finale with Alice, but there wasn't. She didn't show up to any of her finals the first semester, but somehow passed anyway. The same happened the next semester, but she apparently dropped out at the beginning of sophomore year. I hope she got her anger issues dealt with and got some self-awareness, but I'd rather not see her again.Next time, I'll share the story of the nice guy who threatened to rape me, kill my friends and family, and tried sleeping in my house at night.tl;dr Girl from my freshman dorm asks out the majority of girls in our dorm and guilts them for not dating her, ends up getting a no-contact order with one, creeps on me too, and eventually drops out.",0.529997,0.57013,0.0,0.0,0.514226,0.0,0.0,0.14621559633027523
s,"I am looking for advice, I am not a mother and had a VERY different upbringing than the child involved. A few days back a close family friends 16 year old daughter (Anna) reached out to me (23F) for advice. I took her to get lunch and chat.

I'm sure this has taken a toll on her self esteem and shes been sort of going through an image overhaul.&amp;#x200B;Her mom discussed with us that she has been really dependent on her boyfriend.

But, I  never judged a friend for having sex and enjoyed getting hot and heavy.&amp;#x200B; But I also knew about protection.&amp;#x200B;Anna let me know her and boyfriend began having sex 4 weeks ago and try and do it every other day (upon hearing that I first thought ""that sounds exhausting"") and she wanted advice on different techniques. I didn't feel comfortable telling her that but I did give her some advice; I told her that even though they're a couple they still have to consent, just because hes her boyfriend doesn't mean he is entitled to sex and I told her what I wish I knew awhile back, pain isn't normal and if it hurts speak up. I also mentioned that protection is extremely important and that when she hit me with the bombshell, ""We don't use condoms."" I let her know that condoms are important and that pill isn't always effective, she then said ""Oh yeah I'm not on the pill, we just don't have sex when I'm on my period."" Before I could stop myself I blurted out ""Anna are you stupid?! You aren't using protection? Do you realize you can become pregnant? Get STDs and STIs? Are fucking kidding me? Your boyfriend and you don't go to the same school, what if he is sleeping around? What if he had something from a previous relationship? Are you kidding me?"" I admit, I lost my cool, but I can't stand to see her in a terrible situation. She was angry and left.

My preceptor is old school and is bitching as we go over to this house saying "" I bet it's just another lame ass call because they are to dumb to take a 5 dollar taxi instead of $1200 ambulance ride.

c,"You will be fine in clinicals, I was a CI at the largest hospital here in Montgomery for a few years and took on multiple students per year. My suggestion would be just be willing to do whatever, but hold of on volunteering to move really big patients, and don't pull on people. In other words just do what they ask, but at any point where they are asking you to move someone really big, play it up like you are uncomfortable and afraid you will drop them. The biggest issue that caused me to give bad grades were poor attitudes, and people being unwilling to try things. For example I had a student tell me, ""It's not my job to clean shit and I am not going to do it"" lol, not that I can blame them for not wanting to do it, but the reality is we do sometimes have to assist with cleaning patients like it or not.

s,"As of recently I began working with a local VSO who has been really helpful in helping me understand how the VA process for disability is set up and what they look for. I tried myself getting help a long time ago and really couldn't get anywhere. I also found this medium a great source of knowledge from fellow Veterans. Thanks to all of you out there who take the time to help your fellow Vets. One of the things I've noticed over the years as a result of my service is chronic back pain.

I've tried everything from massages to therapy to inversion tables and other gadgets designed to alleviate back pain. All that said, my back pain never seems to go away. Working with my VSO I was asked if I had ever been diagnosed with a back condition or if I had ever been seen by a doctor for this. I then remembered having seen several private doctors for this and began requesting my medical records from them. One of these doctors diagnosed me with congenital spinal stenosis which is a narrowing of the spine that causes back pain from pressure that is applied to the spinal nerves as a result of it. I was also diagnosed with degenerative disc disease.

c,"First I want to say I'm so sorry this happened to you. Your ex is, as others have said, a very shitty person and I'm glad you can say he's your EX and not current boyfriend.  As for dealing with your new boobs, when you say ""cope"" with the change do you mean just bras, dealing with the stares, the emotions, or all 3? Based on personal experience I'm guessing the latter :) Lots of good advice has been given, but I'll do my best to add my two cents where they might be worth something.  **Bras** As you'll hear on this sub sooner or later, finding a bra whose *shape* matches your boobs is just as important as size. I admit I have no idea how having a boob job might affect this. One thing to know up front that is very counterintuitive is that unlined, ""just fabric"" bras can be just as, if not more so, supportive than molded-cup bras. However, for some brands the fabric can be a little itchy. Personally, I've found molded-cup bras that were lined with scratchier material than some unlined bras - it really depends on the brand &amp; model. Based on how willing your new boobs are to ""take the shape of their container,"" and of course their own shape and the ""footprint"" on your body, you will probably need to try to a lot of bras (like over a dozen) to find the \~perfect\~ one. That is ok and normal!! Because your boobs are so much heavier now, the differences between bad/ok/goldilocks fit will be a lot more noticeable than before. Boobs come in so many shapes and sizes, there is just no way a handful of brands, each making a handful of models, could possibly encompass all the boob shapes of the world :) So be gentle with yourself if you try on bra after bra that doesn't work. It's not a ""you-problem,"" it's just the nature of trying to fit a highly structured piece of clothing to the one area of your body with THE MOST variables.  Personally, my boobs have kind of a blunt, round-ish shape with even fullness and a smaller footprint than actual boob width (""omega shape""). I imagine this shape might be similar to implants? No idea? I've had big boobs since I was a kid, and when I was in the 32G neighborhood the Fantasie Smoothing T-shirt molded cup bras and Chantelle unlined balconettes were my go-tos. Both had a narrow profile that kept my boobs from splaying sideways. This has a very slimming effect and can help disguise their size.  The Freya Deco bra is another popular and easy-to-find molded cup option. It has a pretty rounded shape without being silly-looking on larger sizes. All these are sold at Nordstrom. An unlined bra that I find has a less pointy shape without sitting *too far* out to the sides is Elomi Morgan and Kim **Dressing Around Your Boobs** To start, bras that keep the 'width' of your boobs from being wider than your ribcage will have an overall slimming effect and help to minimize them visually. For unlined bras, look for bras with only vertical seams. Most 3-piece construction bras will encourage a projected shape but with some sideways splaying. A great example of a 3-piece bra that DOESN'T send tissue sideways is Panache Jasmine (although I find the material a little scratchy). The Fantasie Smoothing T-Shirt bra is the only molded cup bra I've ever found that had a narrow, slim silhouette.  Tops with a high, ""modest"" neckline (crew neck, turtleneck) will actually emphasize your boobs. V-necks and moderate scoop necks break up the visual line/curve instead of leaving a blank canvas for your boobs to stand out on. Having a scarf handy to ""cover up"" in case of nipping through or suddenly be in an environment you're extra self-conscious in can be handy. Obviously, tight-fitting tops are going to emphasize them more than looser ones. But tops that are too drapey can give the dreaded ""tent"" effect. When I was a teenager and wanted to neutralize my 32FF boobs without looking frumpy, I often wore small tees from the men's section! They have a boxy cut that accommodated my boobs without having a tent effect. This trick works best with narrower bras mentioned above. **Everything Else** I understand therapy is a no-go for you. From your story, it sounds like your ex really wore you down on the boob job thing and maybe you, like SO MANY women were raised (programmed?) to internalize the idea that their needs and desires are negotiable. There is no doubt your ex is manipulative and selfish, and in no way am I trying to blame you for the consequences of his astoundingly inconsiderate behavior. But if you are beating yourself up, asking *why* it happened, and you want to keep it from happening again, books that deal with boundaries (and lack thereof) could be really helpful for you.  For major boundaries like the one he crossed, the patterns we follow are often set in childhood, even if we don't (and no one really does on their own) realize it. For example, kids are commonly conditioned to allow ""special"" people to violate their personal boundaries when their grandparent/auntie/uncle etc wants to kiss their face, pinch their cheeks, give them a big hug and the kid doesn't want to... When their parent is distressed by this and instructs them ""give your grandmother a hug!"" even though their child may be super uncomfortable, they are teaching their child that they should allow their personal boundaries to be violated so that someone else's feelings aren't hurt - that *other's feelings are more important than their autonomy*.  There are a ton of great books that deal with this. But one thing I really struggled to find a good book about was **how to be nicer to oneself.** The Mindful Self Compassion Workbook by Germer &amp; Neff will really help you tease out the nuances of how this - not ""stop being so harsh on yourself!"" but what to *actually* replace negative self-talk with. It holds your hand and walks you through step-by-step how to shift your inner dialogue to something loving and supportive. This in turn makes e v e r y t h i n g easier and will improve your quality of life, regardless of what else you have going on.  One last thing - now is the time to really pay attention to posture and core strength! This will help manage the back pain. Also, start talking to your doctor about back pain and possibly physical therapy. The weight of your new boobs is going to affect how your body supports itself. Even if they're not able to do anything now (especially with COVID), make sure your doctor notes the back pain in your file. A documented history of this can be helpful in securing an insurance-covered reduction down the road. r/reduction is also a great and welcoming resource :)  &amp;#x200B; Whew! I hope some of this was helpful. I'm so sorry you have to go through this. If you have any questions or want to talk, you can always message me.

c,"Your solution is hemp flower my friend. Order yourself an ounce and kiss THC dependence goodbye. Check out tweedlefarms.com. The following spiel below is my 5 star review of a particular strain, but it’s only one out of hundreds of 5 star reviews. Try it and get back to me, I’d love to hear about your results: For a decade, I’ve been wanting to lay off this weaponized pot they put out nowadays. Lots of people don’t want to believe THC is, let’s say, ‘habit forming’ but for some people, it is. Despite cutting down my intake by taking efficient, economical one hitters throughout the day everyday, I of course still could not quit smoking weed. Once I heard about high CBD and low THC strains, I knew that’s what I needed. I live in NY, but found myself in CO a couple times and scored said strains. What civilized stuff. After running out and coming home, I asked every weed dealer I knew if they had CBD strains, to no avail. A few weeks ago, I found out about hemp flowers, and ordered an ounce of this stuff. It’s exactly what I was looking for to wean me off THC. For me, it has eliminated the withdrawal symptoms, restored my long-lost REM phase of sleep (curtailing my ADD symptoms), and most importantly, still provides the oral fixation and ritual of weed smoking that I missed so much when I tried to turn to vaping to cutdown/quit. Not to mention it helps with anxiety and back pain but ya’ll knew that already.  If you think you can admit to yourself that you need to cutback or quit smoking weed, grab yourself an ounce of this stuff and smoke it to your heart’s content. I don’t miss getting stoned at all, I’d rather smoke this stuff. I’ll smoke weed again on the proper occasions, but not without mixing it in with this great smelling, chill feeling, and beautiful looking product.",0.611196,0.61388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270516717325228

s,"I am posting from a throwaway account, for obvious reasons. I am changing some minor details so that family doesn't figure out who I am (or if they do, they don't too quickly.)A couple of years ago, I found myself pregnant. This was not planned and I was no longer with the father. He had, in fact, cheated on me. I had dumped him and told him to get out of my life before I found out I was pregnant. When it came to the point that I had to tell him, he asked me why I hadn't aborted it and then said it wasn't his responsibility. That's fine, whatever, I had made the choice to place for adoption regardless. I had no job and was living on a friends couch. I couldn't raise a child. He quickly signed away his rights to the child and that was the end of that. When I told my Nmom about my pregnancy and my plans, she somehow made it all about her. She couldn't understand why I hadn't told her that I was sexually active, and she would've given me advice on how to make it better and just...no. Just no. She offered to help me financially until I found a job and/or an adoptive couple. The state medical insurance offered free taxi rides to doctors appointments but she said that if I took those, she would no longer help. She had to be present at all of my appointments. Including the naked appointments, the vaginal inspections, all of them. SOOOOO FUCKING FUN. Around 8 1/2 months, I ended up pulling the tendon that connects your leg to your groin. Any movement was painful. The doctor signed me out of work (sorry, I skipped that, I found a shitty job) and put me on bed rest. Suddenly, my Nmom was no longer able to help. She had a revelation from god that she was helping me too much and that revelation came in the form of back pain. I was lucky that the adoptive parents I had chosen were/are such amazing people. They took me to all of my non-stress test appointments. My Nmom had, at this point, gone around to her friends and church members (going so far as giving a lesson in church) about how good of a person she was for helping her sinner daughter. I would get emails and texts from members of her church telling me how lucky I was to have someone like her help me. Apparently, she was telling people she was still helping me. I went into labor at 41 weeks and when I texted her to let her know, she told me I didn't know what I was talking about. At this point, I had been timing contractions for about 4 hours and had been having them for about 8 before that. I was in labor. She refused to believe me and even said I was just trying to get attention. I ended up having to have my sister take me to the hospital. I arrived at 7cm dilated. When my Nmom finally arrived, she insisted on being in the room with me and the adoptive parents. She wouldn't leave and the nurses wouldn't force her to. She kept crying about ""her little girl, oh she's in pain, oh my little girl"" and then when the nurses left she would tell me to suck it up and stop trying to get so much attention. Needless to say, my son's adoptive parents don't like her for this. After I had him, I spent 3 days in the hospital. I had a tough delivery and the doctor requested that a family member stay in the hospital with me. She said she would (cringe) and then around 9pm on the first night, said that her back was hurting and that she had prayed about it and god told her to go home. I spent all three nights in the hospital alone. ",0.56094,0.570662,0.655928,0.50688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19548872180451127
c,"I'm a bit conflicted about this post. Congrats on reaching your goal :) But it's not that bad, though? &amp;nbsp; It just feels a little unbalanced to only mention the downsides. It's like ""if you write down everything that is bad in your life, it will take up 1-2 pages. But if you write down everything you are grateful for, it will be ENDLESS."" :) The same goes for weightloss. &amp;nbsp; Also, we humans can only focus on one thing at a time. We can either focus on something negative or something positive. Which we choose will more or less determine our lives. So while the list is true, it's only the *small* part of the truth that is negative. The *big* part is the positive but it's not mentioned. &amp;nbsp; &gt;1) Your hair may fall out. Or it may not. I've always had strong, thick hair and I haven't noticed a change. But what I did notice was that I've always wanted to have short hair and hated the way I looked before, but was afraid to cut it off because I didn't want anyone to see my face - the long hair was to hide myself. After losing the weight I now wear my (short!!!) hair PROUDLY :) &amp;nbsp; &gt;2) Clothing budgets get expensive as you change sizes and you're going to have to give up some of your favorites. When I lost the weight, I gradually found more and more and more old favorites in the closet, clothes I hadn't been able to wear for years. It was so fun to go through the closet and get all these ""instant new clothes"" and they were all my favorite styles (because I had picked them out myself when I was that size). :) I also had this incredible joyous visit to H&amp;M right after losing the weight where I was just gobsmacked to try on things I've never tried before, like crop tops, dresses, tank tops, etc, etc and *looked good in everything*. No more crying in the dressing room lol! Also it got cheaper after that one blowout at H&amp;M and every other store in sight, now I'm still wearing all those and I'm not as crazy for shopping clothes anymore, I'd rather spend money on other interests. I still look great it those things though :) Maybe you have to let go of some old favorites, but that's life. Life changes. We move on, to greater things. &amp;nbsp; &gt;3) You're going to lose friends. This one I can agree with. But I also think you make many new friends. Some noteable friends I lost were - two guys who I had imbalanced relationships with, I was always the one trying to get in touch with them and they never tried to talk to me. I just got tired of running after people who weren't interested and putting myself down like that. I also seem to have lost one very good female friend because she tried to lose weight and was extremely successful, and we did it together for awhile, but she burned out and then doesn't want to talk anymore because I am maintaining. So friendships do change when one person changes. But again, it's life. Life is change. I think people are in our lives for a reason, a season or a lifetime. Maybe those people just weren't lifetimers. We always think we'll have the same friends for all our lives but in reality, in 10 years time almost all our friends will have rotated out. &amp;nbsp; &gt;4) People won't recognize you. I don't see this as a big problem in my life. Many people put this as an NSV also. ""Yay, people don't know who I am anymore"" lol :) &amp;nbsp; &gt;5) It's going to hurt. The extra padding over bones is gone! I use double yoga mats. :) But seriously, if your ass hurts when you're sitting down I think it's a badge of honor. I'll take it anyday over destroyed knees grinding bone on bone, excruciating back pain when the spine gets compressed by your weight, and well all the other millions of aches and pains you may experience while overweight. &amp;nbsp; &gt;6) Praise from friends, family, or even strangers, can feel bad This one I think is very dependent on how you choose to see it. If someone says ""You look great"" you can choose to see it as ""They think I look great!"" or ""They think I looked bad before"". Which one you choose determines your life. &amp;nbsp; &gt;7) You may look older. Or not. I think I look older now but I am older, lol. I did use to look younger than my age when I had fatter cheeks, but to be fair I was like 35 then and now I'm not haha.  I also have an IG friend who lost 200 lbs and looks like she also aged backwards and is now at least 10 years younger. Also u/hxcjosh23 with his cute little babyface lol :) It's highly individual! :) Fat does make some folks look very old and frumpy. Many plus sized clothes also make you look very frumpy and older than your years. &amp;nbsp; &gt;8) You may not be shaped or look quite how you were before you gained weight, even at the same weight. True. You can never go back home. Unless you own a time machine :) Sometimes I think we have irrational expectations from our weightloss. &amp;nbsp; &gt;9) You can never quit. Maintenance can be as difficult as weight loss.  This one is true, the part about having a plan and continuing with the habits you (hopefully) implemented during the weightloss phase. However I don't agree with maintenance being hard, I don't think it has to be. It does require changing your eating habits for life. But if you are consistent with the changes it won't be a huge struggle for you, at least it's not like my life is a living hell of restriction and hardship (I've maintained almost 2 years).  But I think it's important that people understand that they can't go back to their old ways and expect to stay thin. Our bodies are in constant flux and state of change. &amp;nbsp; So I think you wrote a great post about things people might find out when they lose it, and it can be good to manage your expectations so it's not a big shock when there are drawbacks. It's just such a dull way of looking at life, I feel, to go *searching for the bad stuff* like a needle in a haystack of amazing, wonderful things to be grateful for. :) Maybe it's just me, lol.

c,"In my own totally unprofessional experience, most of the time, I practice meditation after doing yoga or some kind of physical exercise. I do this because I believe in the saying that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body. in that sense, meditating is like exercising my mind. the fact that you take your time to sort of train your mind is already significant and with time you can see different results, depending on your own mind, exactly like what happens with the body. I think what makes meditation a positive thing is that you are basically taking care of your mind, you are being self conscious of your thoughts and emotions and helping yourself by looking into it, recognizing what affects you in a bad light and taking it into a good light. again, same as with the body.

s,"To start off, I absolutely love this girl. She is such a sweet heart. One thing I've noticed though, and it has been this way since I met her, is that she gets sick very often. By sick, I mean a combination of migraines, joint pain, muscle aches, back pain, stomach aches, etc... These ailments seem to come up every few weeks, sometimes spanning for days at a time. She performs bi-yearly checkups with her doctor who has never found anything wrong with her. She eats very healthy with a well balanced diet. She exercises approx. 4-5 times a week. In fact, based on all the work she puts in, she should be healthier than I am.The fact is, her aches and pains get in the way of a lot of our plans. For example, it is my bday weekend and she is sick again with body aches. From past experience, I know this means she's going to be extremely tired and grumpy while I go out with my friends. Another thing she does is refuse to stay home while I get to enjoy myself. She just drags herself along and I have to contend with her mood rather than have fun (which usually ends with us fighting). I honestly don't think my friends have met her when she wasn't some kind of sick.The main reason I feel it might be a psychological thing is because she is a very anxious person. Whenever life stresses arise she seems to get sicker. Another thought that nags at me is the way her mother is. She is one of those that claims she has fibromyalgia (which I believe was popular in the 80s-90s) and now she has a self-diagnosed gluten intolerance. This woman continuously complains about pain and I believe she's on a cocktail of pain meds. I don't believe a word she says because she's one of those people who follows trends religiously as if to feel relevant. What scares me is that this has rubbed off on my gf, at least when it comes to feeling ill.The main problem I have with all this is that bringing it up makes her feel like I think she's crazy.

Also my therapist's uncle has gone through it twice (yes these ppl have all had PAWS from getting clean from weed). He is over 2 years and better but still not 100 percent yet. All these stories give me hope. N I hope this brings hope to others that are over the 2 year or close to the 2  year mark and still not 100. Its nothing like the beginning but it still is crap bc all we want is to feel better officially. (My title isn't just talking about PAWS. ) Anyway I had it bad. PAWS has been the most difficult shit I have ever experienced and I have gone through some fucked up shit. I would rather go through labor for 2 or 3 years without any pain meds all day everyday than to go through PAWS ever again. So really slow progress but still progress. I reached my 2 year (March)mark and have a bad wave but notice much more progress. My emotions really reared their head and I was seeing the light even more!.....then a month after my two year mark.....I get perscribed an antibiotic for a UTI I didn't have and was told to take it anyway. Well I had a severe allergic reaction and end up in the hospital. Its every tramatic...anyway I got shot up with all kinds of shit to stablize me. I was admitted and kept for observation after I somewhat stabilized. I was really worried about all those meds fucking up my progress but noone can give me any answers.Two days after I get home I have a bad panic attack but I manage to calm down and fall asleep. Well I wake up the next morning and I felt bad then stomach acid shot up into my chest and down my stomach. I had to use the bathroom asap and ran to the other bathroom to throw up. I was like that for the rest of the day. And that burning hasn't gone away sense. I can't eat or sleep and I have had meds just thrown at me that don't help for shit and noone to ask if they will mess with me and countless tests. Things at first felt like almost my first year of PAWS but different. Its hard to explain. The thing is that I was still in the progress of getting better so I have no clue where the fuck I stand. I haven't felt the same sense. Like during my worst of PAWS I was very keep moving forward bc I have always been that person but I dont feel like that anymore. I don't feel like myself and my emotions seem fucking far yet again. It sucks bc I couldn't officially get better from one thing when I got hit with another.

I never used that crap bc I wanted to be an addict or whatever. I actually hated that crap. But then the whole fad of its ""medicine"" and blah blah blah. I fell for it bc I have degenerative disk disease and I have had chronic  back pain sense iI was 4. The irony was that I didn't want any pain meds bc I didn't want to get addicted/withdrawal. Welp jokes on me!  I just feel hopless bc you learn to tell the difference between PAWS and all the other of life's crap and well its all coming together and just beating my ass.

c,"Here are the sources of mental stress I've dealt with: 1) Body image. This was an issue more when I was younger, although now that I'm in my 40s it doesn't bother me as much. I appear pretty straight from the front because my curve is balanced, but when friends I'd made would see my back in a bathing suit for the first time, they would freak out and ask me insensitive things like ""how can you live like this"". It made me feel like some evil mutant who was trying to deceive ""normal"" people.  2) Pain. The intermittent lower back pain and rib pain flareups are terrible and take up so much mental energy.  3) Drug side effects. I've been taking opioids on and off for 30 years, and I guess the silver lining of not being able to tolerate them well means I've never become addicted. But the side effects suck. Oxycodone and hydrocodone make me so nauseous I have to take promethazine with them, which knocks me out. Tramadol used to be OK but now gives me terrible heartburn, so the only way I can take it is to pop Pepcid like popcorn. Right now I only use it for special social occasions because I always have a nasty opioid hangover the next day. 4) Limitation. Because my flareups are intermittent, I've spent years in between having a fairly active life but dreading the next onset. I used to love to hike and garden, now I can't even bend down to pull up a weed.  5) Dealing with the pathetic United States medical system while not being rich. I was uninsured for a long time before the ACA (thanks, Obama!) since pre-2010 it was completely impossible for me to get private health insurance because my scoliosis is a pre-existing condition. The ACA has been a lifesaver but the insurance still kind of sucks, hardly covers any physical therapy and forces me to deal with so much gatekeeping. I'm tired of dealing with terrible doctors (they're not all bad but so many of them just look at patients as sacks of meat and cash)  - one of the last ones I had blithely told me, ""don't feel bad everyone has a little scoliosis"" which is not just insulting but totally medically wrong. 6) Self-doubt. Am I making the right decisions? Seeing the right doctors? Am I not stretching enough? Am I not spending enough time taking care of myself? Am I being selfish for taking too much time to care for myself instead of on my family? 7) Fear. What if things keep getting worse? What if I can't get surgery? What if I get surgery but I don't handle recovery well? Is my life just going to be a further downward spiral of pain and limitation until I die? After going through that depressing list I thought I'd offer some ways of dealing with it that have been helpful for me. A) learning about disability rights and the social model of disability was very helpful. For example, the concept every human being is really only ever temporarily able bodied. Unless we die young and suddenly, we're all going to end up with pain and limitations. So we should treat that as part of the normal human experience and not something shameful and terrible to be hidden away. B) Talking about my issues openly and listening to other people who have been dealing with similar issues. C) Drugs - I'm not on any psych meds right now but in the past, Prozac/fluoxetine has helped cut out some of the worst parts of depression. D) Religion (I am a Buddhist).

s,"Hi y'all. I received a medical abortion from PP on April 3/4th for a pregnancy that was 4 weeks along. My bleeding began late into the evening on the 3rd and proceeded until the tenth. It was a typical procedure and I had a pleasant experience with PP (minus the terrible cramps that ensued after the second bout of pills I took at home). Follow up determined the abortion was successful and that my uterine wall was almost back to its normal thickness after 7 days. HOWEVER, I now currently live outside of the US with very limited health insurance. I received birth control which medical providers told me I had to wait until my next cycle to begin taking. They weren't aware of the abortion I had and said that if I started taking the pill before my period started then it wouldn't work properly. The problem is that I haven't gotten my first period since my abortion. It's been five weeks. I had unprotected sex (pull-out method) a handful of times since the abortion and am seriously concerned that I'm pregnant again. I've experienced some mild cramping the last couple days but am so paranoid that I've convinced myself it's implantation cramps. They've been rippling in my lower abdomen and hips since the day before last, but we're significantly more prominent today.  My ovaries twinge a bit here and there, which was a normal part of my cycle before my abortion. I've also had a few other mild PMS symptoms (hormonal breakouts, lower back pain, boob soreness) but I'm nowhere near as exhausted as I was during the month I was pregnant. Coffee isn't affecting me like it did either; I was easily overly caffeinated (jittery and nauseous) from a very small amount of coffee when I was pregnant.

I took advantage of every second of our stops. I did calf raises in the car, chugged water bottles, you name it I did it. Fast forward to our trip back home from Florida. The next day while mowing my lawn I had an aching on and off calf pain all day. Didn’t worry too much about it until about 2 days later during the evening I had the worst back pain imaginable. It was so bad I couldn’t lay down on my bed to sleep, it felt like someone was repeatedly stabbing my back with a knife so after googling all night and putting 2 and 2 together I was finally convinced I had a PE and that it wasn’t my hypochondria this time. Everything made sense, the 24 hour long road trip, the calf pain, the back pain, This was it!!!!. I freaked out all night and told myself I’d go to urgent care the next day, I only slept for 2 hours that night sitting in a chair. 7am I Flew to urgent care, told them my story. They sent me for an ultrasound on the leg I had the calf pain in and a D-dimer, after 30 minutes of waiting and accepting my agonizing fate the nurse came back and told me everything came back clear and it was all muscle-skeletal. I was relieved, later that day I went to a chiropractor who did his magic on my back and the pain disappeared. Moral of the story, even if your symptoms perfectly match up to whatever illness you think you have. Chances are you probably don’t have what you think you do. Anxiety is extremely powerful and can convince you that you can have anything if you convice yourself hard enough.  Go play a video game or watch YouTube video’s.

c,"I'm 54, and the focus is on sustainability, muscle mass retention and not hurting yourself.  It takes a lot longer to heal at 55 than 20, so I focus on high reps at moderate weight.  The joints are going to rot at some level no matter what, so I don't run.  Bicycle, elliptical for cardio half an hour three or four times a week.  Commute by bike two or three times a week in the summer gives two good 45 minute workouts each of those days.  I lift twice a week, all upper body, high reps.  Two sets cycling through five exercises which vary, but two of the five exercises are core strength.  The back is going to rot; the only way to alleviate being crippled by back pain is core strength.  So: pullup machine twenty reps, crunch machine 32 reps, bench press 20 reps, exercise ball leg lift (facing down, to hit back muscles at the base of the spine) 32 reps, bar dips 20 reps.  Increase weight, repeat.  I'll change up one of the exercises every month or two.  Last month instead of crunch machine I grabbed a bar hooked at one end to the cable machine and did full twists standing up, 32 reps each side.  Core strength is everything.  So that's how I'm getting old.  If I'm going to hurt all the time, may as well be a good kind of hurt.

When i woke up i felt awful, but awake enough to just get myself home. When i got home I ordered a take away but I didn’t eat it when it arrived. The fever had kicked in and I laid in bed and literally soaked the sheets and bedcovers with sweat. I woke up on Sunday morning and it physically hurt to open my eyelids. I felt scared. I genuinely wondered if I was going to die. Because it was pre covid really hitting the UK when I called 111 (non emergency number) I was dismissed as just having the flu. I text a couple of friends and my mum asking them to check on me every 12 hours by text/phone call because I was scared.

c,"You can totally treat a herniated disc at home. Look up Robin McKenzie and the McKenzie method. It’s all about peripheralization and centralization.  1. Do you have numbness / tingling in your legs or glutes.  2. Does standing forward bend increase your symptoms? 3. If forward bending increases lower extremity numbness tingling or pain this is considered peripheralizing and is no good. Means you are compressing the herniated disc further and putting more pressure on the nerve. Can be very dangerous if left untreated.  4. If forward bending increases symptoms then you need to perform lumbar extension biased exercises to push the disc back into place. This should cause centralization which means that lower extremity sensation comes out of your legs and into your back. You might experience increase low back pain. As long as pain / tingling are coming out of your lower extremities this is a good thing.  Lumbar extension exercises consists of (in order to allow disc to heal 1. Prone resting on elbows (5-10 minutes) (think about a kid laying on his stomach watching tv resting on your belly with elbows underneath your chest) 2. Prone press ups ( at least 3 x 10 reps) (push up position keeping your hips glued to the floor and pressing your chest off the floor) 3. Standing back bends ( perform when you can’t lay on the floor) I would start with this. It can take a disc up to 7 months to fully heal. You have to avoid movements that cause peripheralization (for most people this is bending forward, i.e make sure you squat down to pick something up)  if you begin to feel symptoms in your legs immediately perform extension biased exercises if these do in fact Centralize your pain.

s,"Hi! I'm 17F, 5'8"", 143lbs. I read the FAQ and wiki but I'm still not sure on what I should be doing.I have a couple goals:1) Increase my endurance and increase my sprinting speed.I play on my school's Ultimate team and I'd really like to improve those aspects for the sport. Should I be focusing on running long distances/times or do things more like HIIT/Tabata? The last time I went on a run was probably early January and I ran 45mins straight for about 7k in distance, but I'm not very fast and I think my endurance has gone down a bit.2) Lose about 5-10lbs. Or lose enough weight for a flatter stomach by the summer.3) Gain muscle/Be stronger.Not sure on the exact numbers I want to lose, but I want to lose some fat off my belly by the summer. Yeah, I know you can't spot reduce, so basically I want to lose some weight (whether its 3 or 6 or 10lbs) until I like the state of my body. Then gain some muscle. Right now, I just started a 1650 cal diet. I have a fitbit and my expenditure varies from 1800 to 2700 on some days but the average is about 2150. I haven't seen much progress so I tried to track calories. The problem with that is I have no idea how much I'm eating for dinner as it will be a home cooked meal prepared by my mom.I want to weight lift with barbells but I really don't know how to get started as I don't know proper form and pretty shy to try things out in the gym. I bought the Starting Strength book and I'm just starting to read it, so hopefully that will help.4) Fix my back/neck pain.My back and neck is almost constantly in pain for about 2-4 years? not exactly sure when it started. Some days it's not that bad and other days it's bad enough to give me a constant headache, but I'll prettymuch be sitting in class and tilting my head all the time to stretch my neck. I went to the doctor and took an xray. My spine is fine and so they basically told me to take some advil or alieve when it gets bad and maintain good posture and do stretches in the shower. It didn't really help. I went to the chiropractor and the pain got better but as I stopped going, it basically reverted. The chiropractor told me to do 10 sets of things like: superman, plank, wall angels, neck stretches etc. but I bored after 3 sets and stopped doing them altogether. It didn't seem to help much either. I think believe that I just need to strengthen the muscles in my back/neck and maintain good posture. Any suggestions?What should I be doing? Right now, I have ultimate practice for 2.5-3 hours on Tues &amp; Thurs and I have no time for anything due to other extracurriculars on Mondays.My Questions are:1. What can I do to improve my cardio and speed? I tried to motivate myself to go on frequent runs but it hasn't been happening. I feel as the weather gets nicer and if I schedule it, I'll probably be more likely to stick to it though.2. Should I finish reading SS and follow the program while attempting to maintain proper form by myself? Can/should I do this at the same time while doing cardio and ultimate practice? What would a good schedule be?3. I want to lose some weight but also gain strength. If I follow SS I wouldn't be too focused on lift numbers or anything. Will noob gains be enough? Should I cut? maintenance? bulk? Do one at a time? I would rather cut first. Would that be detrimental? Is counting calories extremely important?4. Do you have any suggestions on how I can alleviate my back/neck problems? Should I just expect it to be better as I build some strength? Do you have any specific exercises or stretches to target it? Oh also, does anyone know any good foam roller stretches for it?Oops, this is a bit long. I would appreciate it if anybody can answer even just one of my questions.

I got into the lift on level 19 with one of my colleagues to go downstairs for coffee at about 10am. The doors closed and we started moving normally when there was a jolt and creak and we dropped two feet and stopped. I was told later by a colleague who rang Facilites after hearing the bangs come from the elevator well that the fail-safe kicks in at two feet so it's impossible to fall further than that, you just wait for someone to come get you.  So we're there, and we're looking at each other, the two guys who'd gotten in before us made a joke about getting out of a boring meeting if we're stuck here. Then we hear this low creak getting louder and louder and we move very slightly lower and jolted stopped again. We just looked at each other in horror and there was a massive BANG and we started falling. One of the doors was wrenched partially open and we had tiny pieces of metal flying in at us as we were dragging into the side of the shaft corridor.  Everyone was screaming and hanging onto each other. We fell for maybe 7 or 8 seconds when we slowed, jolted and stopped, and security came over the intercom asking if we were OK, and that we were in between floors 9 and 10. This particular elevator corridor goes from Ground, straight to Level 19 then higher to be quicker. So he said they were going to have to get us down to the ground floor to get us out. We were in there for maybe two hours as someone straightened us out and I guess winched us down.  That elevator was closed for three days while they had people come look at it and fix it up, it's back in operation now and hasn't had any issues. Again, I have no idea how elevators work so I can't give any information on that, just on what we personally experienced from inside of it. We were all fine, there were no serious injuries, just some back pain from bracing against what we thought would be a fatal impact, and minor cuts from the metal coming in at us.

This is the first time I've ever interacted with a cop so I was very nervous and explained that I had no idea. I also asked why he was at my door. He then told me that someone last night of my stature was seen damaging a car and then getting into a black jeep. He saw my jeep out front and ran my plates. I again told him that I had no idea what happened and that i was at my parents that  night, I gave him a time frame and my parents address. My parents confirmed to him that I was with them at the time that the witness saw it happen. Fast forward to this Friday, I wake up to a knock at my door, its a different cop asking if I had anything to do with the  different vandalized car outside and I told him that I was asleep all night and had no idea. I fully woke up and went to speak to the cop again, asking why I'm being singled out and he explained that my window was open and wanted to know if I had heard anything. Fast forward two hours later, the same officee is at my door again, raising his voice, accusing me of damaging both cars and that he just got a call from my downstairs neighbor about me saying that I was talking through the vents and telling him I was gonna kill him. At this point I'm heated because he's accusing me of things i had nothing to do with and i let him know that he better stop harassing me. He then tells me that next time he gets a call to the area he's going to arrest me. I then went to the police station immediately to report him for harassment and accusation without proof. His Sargent refused to file the complaint and i told him i wanted paperwork showing the complaint and still refused to do anything. I then return home and knock on neighbors door asking why he called the cops on me for something I didnt even do, again at this point I am heated because I have done nothing wrong. I go back to my apartment, 15 minutes later i get a knock and four cops show up at my door to only ""cite"" me. You don't send four cops to cite someone, you send four cops to arrest somebody. Again im heated because I've done nothing wrong and yet here the cops are at my door for the 4th time in three weeks. He then tells me to put my hands behind my back. My mom was over at the time and her motherly instincts kicked and she put her hand on the officers arm. He then told her to let go if she didn't want to get arrested and that she needed to get in the house. At this point the officer has punched me in my back and shoved me to the ground. Three cops lay there knees into my back and the main officer  pushed his knee into my neck. I then tell my mom to start recording because this is bullshit. One of the cops throws her phone out of her hands and then arrests her too. As he's hand cuffing me hes yanking my arms together to cuff me and tells me to stop resisting. I wasn't resisting, im a big dude and I couldn't get my hands all the way back. He ended up having to use two sets of cuffs. I even told him as he was cuffing me that he was hurting me, that I'm fat, and he needs to use another pair. He then walks me down the stairs. Right before we exited the building he then hit me in my head three times and told me to stop resisting. Again im not resisting I have a bad ankle that constantly gets sprained because its never been healed properly. He then shoves me up against his car and takes me to jail to get processed. He charged me with disorderly conduct for being loud in my apartment building and resisting to arrest. After my dad bailed out me and my mom we went to the hospital to get myself looked at. At this point i have extreme back pain, along with a raging headache, nausea, and vomiting. These are the doctors words, injury due to physical assault by cops, bilateral wrist pain, abrasions of multiple areas on back, back of head, and knees. Trapezius muscle spazams, trapezius muscle strain, and a concussion. All of this from the main officer and the three cops with him. We later returned at my apartment to grab a few things because ive decided I no longer wanted to live there. My mom goes in for me to grab a few pairs of clothes and my computer. While she's inside she decides to talk to my downstairs neighbor. He then reveals to her that he's a schizophrenic. All this because a schizophrenic called the cops and told them I was going to kill him through the vents. I'm supposed to go to court with my mom on Monday and we don't know how to handle the situation. I think its pretty obvious that the officer garner believes that i vandalized those vehicles and couldn't prove it and found a reason to arrest me instead. All based on a phone call from a schizophrenic, claiming I told him i was gonna kill him through the vents.

c,"Looks strong. Few things though. Mostly speculation and ""just in case"" pointers. 1. As you approach the hole, the bottom of your lift, you look like you do a ""butt wink"" where your lower back curves a bit and more of your glutes squeeze together. This can can lower back pain as your erectors do some contraction and extension instead of only stabilization. To prevent this technique-wise, you can imagine the bottom of your squat to ""split your cheeks."" Body-wise, it can be tight muscles or lack of flezibility forcing you to do that. 2 I cant see your grip and it can possibly just be camera angle, but it looks like your wrists are bent back and not straight. Wrist wraps can help with this, or just focus on strong grip with straight wrists. The barbell will feel more stable and balanced, making the lift not harder than it should be.  3 Cant think of anything else. Looks strong otherwise.

s,"Posted this on r/askdocs in the hope of some help and after lurking on this sub for a while I thought why not try the friendly people over here. Basically having a lot of pain as described in this enormous post below and I wondered could this all be down to my posture. 28m, 180lbs one sided muscle and joint pain.​I am at my wits end here. In October of last year, I woke up with a pain in my lower right abdomen, my right hip and around the SI Joint on the right side of my body. I initially thought this was testicular pain as I had pain in my right testicle the day before.I was checked out by the GP and nothing was untoward, after a few weeks of this pain I was then given a Hip X-Ray to check for osteoarthritis, this came back clear.Over the next few weeks, the pain stayed in my right hip and lower back and right buttock. With sciatic pain increasing over the next few weeks, I had shooting pains down my right hamstring. Through all of this my lower back has remained tight including the upper right butt cheek (gluteus medius I think).The pain however is not constant, on a scale of 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest I'd say I go through most days on a 4 - 5 with the occasional twinge going up to 7-8. Some days it'll be in my lower back predominantly and then the next day in my hip at the front, with the pain in the back almost dissapearing. Some days the pain will be really bad in my groin area and then no where else.I then had an MRI on my lumbar spine, and the consultant commented that it was a very healthy lumbar mri and unremarkable, and also that it's rare to see a lower back with no damage at all. So this ruled out a slipped disc or anything wrong with my spine. The MRI was done around 4 months ago.Since then I would say these symptoms have maybe ""slightly"" improved, but I am still in continuous pain every day, with some worse than others.It gets worse unfortunately, for the past 2 - 3 months, I have been experiencing a deep seated pain in my right shoulder, in the upper part of my back. This is the same as the lower back pain, in that some days it's really prominent and most movements hurt, then some days I can wake up and the pain is not there, as if it's completely disappeared. This pain has spread to my right elbow and forearm and throughout the whole of this I've had strange pain and sensations in my right hand on occasion. At the same time as this, I have noticed over the past few months my joints are super noisy now. I hardly ever used to click or pop when I move, now on some days almost every joint will click or crack on every movement, and then other days this stops.I do yoga every day and have been for the past year or so to try and improve my well being and flexibility. I am a reasonably fit and active guy with my job as a firefighter we have to remain fit, after numerous blood tests ( all completely normal ) and medical exams no one seems to be able to help me.I am praying someone on here can help point me in the right direction.Thank you in advance and sorry for the wall of text!",0.0,0.730272,0.739887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19932998324958123
s,"So, I’ve been out of the game for a while, working at...’Starcups’ but, due to an increase in sciatica flare ups and the severity of them, plus making less than $10/hr with no hope for a raise until one year mark, even then would not bring me to $10. ANYWAYS, I decided I’ll keep it for the benefits but peel back a lot, go part time and try another means of income as I have a few other industries I’m experienced in, child care included.Not soon after, I got a response a few days after my app from a mom who’s job I really liked as far as hours etc., go. We met up and clicked immediately, just as well as we did through messages already. We mostly chatted while 2 of her 3 boys played. She offered me the job instantly and asked me what my pay rate would be. I put in the change of availability at SB and hoped for the best! Though already feeling confident. During the meeting, which was at a park, I noticed there was a skatepark and mentioned my boyfriend skates so I should tell him about it or something, and she told me that Dad used to and recently hopped on when he found his board during their move and realized he’s now too old. I even told her my boyfriend is in a band and does other music things for a living, and I used to work at a venue, and she told me that music is a big interest amongst the whole family, Dad had even taken the oldest 5M to his first show already! Yesterday was my first day, and when I got there, MB and I chatted a lot more. She told me DB is covered in tattoos despite being a corporate man (she saw mine this day, not at the first meeting) and I finally got it out of her (she was afraid of offending me if it was what I listen to) what kind of music he listens to, and it seems it is the genre I worked in! It’s just so perfect, considering so many families I’ve worked for have been so opposite to me in values, appearances, lifestyles, etc. I always feel like I have to wear a whole person costume for these very WASPy families! Y’all know the feeling. And when music and more “alternative interests” are such a big part of my life with my boyfriend and stuff, it’s nice I don’t have to hide it. However, when it got to the caretaking, 1M was having a ROUGH time, which MB warned me about. But it was even worse than she expected. She’s WFH (i know, i know) and he’s never been in anyone else’s care. BUT, y’all, she used to run an in home daycare!! So she gets it!! She was texting me how sorry she was and I assured her it was fine, I only felt bad for both him for being upset and her trying to work while hearing it. He got himself SO WORKED UP, y’all, that he puked. So i called her out for that which she totally understood as she had just texted me that she was here for support. She helped me clean it up as it was on the couch and carpet, and finally I was able to kind of get him to calm down, and nap ONLY in my arms. Then it was an hour of not letting me put him down, and I was feeling bad the older boys were a tad neglected but she totally understood! She apologized all day for how rough it was, but it really wasn’t too bad. It was all understandable and I was so comfortable and supported that it was okay.Today, as I’m heading out for Day 2, I get this long, sweet message from her thanking me again for everything yesterday, that the way I handled everything further solidified to her that I’m the perfect fit for the family. She said she wore the little 2 out and both were down for their nap, and she tried to set me up for success. She let me know again how available she is for help or questions, and it was just the most wholesome and positive message ever, and I of course responded the same.I just felt so deeply in my soul that I needed another source of income that was a better fit for me, and it couldn’t have worked out any better. She also asked how I want my payment, and was totally willing to pay me daily this first week if I needed, which...I totally do!",0.589288,0.59184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.210727969348659

s,"A little background: this happened yesterday, and the day had been a rather shitty one. So I'm aware I was not in the best emotional state already. I have also been going to the chiropractor to get my back fixed and am in month 2 of constant lower back pain so my mood in general is a little worse than usual.To the story:This year I decided to adopt gardening as a hobby, so far I've been enjoying it immensely and invested a bit of money into it. Mostly herbs and vegetables but it's more about watching things grow and knowing I did that rather than a monetary incentive.I currently live with my parents as I am attending university, so on the days I can't be home my mum will water my plants for me but I take care of everything else. In an effort to be supportive she bought me a couple of cherry tomato seedlings and they were finally getting to the point where they were bearing fruit. I get home from work yesterday to find she'd eaten the only one that was ripe. The first thing I had ever grown and I got (reflectively overly) upset about it. She wasn't there at the time so I vented to my dad instead and didn't talk to her for the rest of the night.Fast forward to today I'm still annoyed about it and her reaction didn't help the matter. Her words were along the lines of 'I didn't think you'd get THAT upset about it's implying (at least to me) that she knew I'd be upset about it but did it anyway. Then went on to tell me that it tasted very good. Thanks. And then asked WHY I was so upset about it. I didn't say anything. Because I thought the response of 'well you are the first thing I ever grew' was a dumb one, especially when she'd bought the plants for me and always watered them for me when I wasn't there and did things like drive me to the hardware store (I don't have a car) to get supplies. So I said nothing. She's now pissed off at me for being upset with her.TLDR; started gardening this year, mum had been helping me by watering plants when I wasn't able to but then ate the first tomato I had ever grown.Am I the asshole?",0.593686,0.531983,0.0,0.0,0.538554,0.0,0.0,0.28391959798994976

c,"If you're currently trying to avoid the expense of an MRI, I think there's a lot of other options you can try prior to investing in the scan.  First, there are a variety of exercises and stretches that can be done to improve back pain, including strengthening of the core and stretching the hip flexors.  Also, how old is your mattress?  Is it hard or soft?  One of the more effective treatments in common low back pain is a new, harder mattress...  Which might actually be cheaper than the MRI depending on your insurance coverage. Being a young male with back pain greater than 6 months, ankylosing spondylitis isn't unlikely but not impossible.  You might ask your doctor about it and see if he would be willing to order an HLA-B27 blood test, which is a screening test.

s,"[Photo Album](http://imgur.com/a/Twkh4)Went to the hospital Tuesday night because I was having bad back pain and was having contractions every 30 minutes but very painful. I wasn't sure but I had thought my water broke. When I got there they said it hadn't, that the baby had just been preventing me from emptying my bladder and the gush I felt as I leaned to get paper was just more pee.They wanted to keep me for a couple hours and monitor my contractions because they were getting closer together. The midwife on call acted like she was going to send me home. At 11PM they said they were going to monitor me for one more hour and then probably send me home. That was at shift change, I guess the next nurse that came on said something a bit different to her and she decided to let me stay. When I woke up in the morning a different midwife was on call. I was scheduled to go into the office for an OB checkup that morning to see if scheduling an induction could be possible. The midwife on call said that was silly and that she could just induce me right then and there instead of sending me to the office and then back to the hospital. She said ""Do you want to have a baby today?"" I nervously replied ""Do you??""Within the hour they had the pitocin drip going and at 9AM they broke my water. I was only 2-3cm. I had my epidural around 11AM. By Noon I was 6cm and they increased the pitocin. By 3PM I was 9cm and the baby was at 0. They had checked me at 3PM because the epidural medicine was empty and I was starting to feel intense pain. (Mostly in my right side. The epidural numbed my left side and left the pain on my right side) Right before they checked me that time my visitors stepped out. My grandpa and his girlfriend and then my grandma. They went to take a cigarette break and jokingly told me to not have the baby before they got back... but I did. They had came back up right as I was in the last stages of pushing and they weren't allowed to enter. My grandma almost got arrested trying to bust through the door because they didn't tell her I was in labor, she assumed something was wrong.As soon as they finished checking me I started saying ""The baby is coming I can feel it."" It was just me and my Great Aunt, who has been my rock throughout this pregnancy. Things happened wonderfully because my grandpas annoying girlfriend wanted to be in the room while I was giving birth and I didn't know how to tell her no. My grandma also wanted to be in the room but she is one of those people that screams OH MY LORD over absolutely nothing so... she would have stressed me out. I got what I wanted and it was just me and my Aunt. Anyways.. They rushed to get the room together and put my legs up. I couldn't lift my left leg on my own so they kept having to lift it up for me. After about the third time letting my legs down only to have to pick them up again I yelled ""THIS IS TIRING ME OUT I'M LEAVING THEM UP!"" They hardly gave me time to breathe between pushes because my contractions were coming so fast. After what felt like a timeless journey they said to push one good hard time and then they laid the baby on my stomach. I instantly had tears running down my face from feeling overwhelmed and my jaw was at the floor because of how gigantic he looked. Weighing in at 8lbs 3oz, 21in long, with a 13cm head, my son Elijah was born at 3:46pm.

s,"The spontaneous loss of a woman’s pregnancy before the 20th week that can be both physically and emotionally painful.[**Miscarriage**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage) is the most common type of pregnancy loss and often occurs because the foetus isn’t developing normally.**Causes of miscarriage: -****Why Do Miscarriages Happen?**According to the American Pregnancy Association (APA), the most common cause of miscarriage is a genetic abnormality in the embryo. But several other factors can also be the culprit, including thyroid disorders, diabetes, immunological disorders, drug abuse, and more.While there are some things that increase the risk of miscarriage, generally it isn’t a result of something that you did or didn’t do. If you’re having difficulty maintaining pregnancy, your doctor may check for some known causes of miscarriage.During pregnancy, your body supplies hormones and nutrients to your developing foetus. This helps your foetus grow. Most first trimester miscarriages happen because the foetus doesn’t develop normally. There are different factors that can cause this.Symptoms of miscarriage: -Here are some of the symptoms of a miscarriage:* Heavy spotting* Vaginal bleeding* Discharge of tissue or fluid from your vagina* Severe abdominal pain or cramping* Mild to severe back pain**Types of miscarriages: -****Threatened miscarriage**When your body is showing signs that you might miscarry, that is called a ‘threatened miscarriage’. You may have a little vaginal bleeding or lower abdominal pain. It can last days or weeks and the cervix is still closed.https://preview.redd.it/e1sf0qenulv51.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bc33eba6e8e292c484fcded581dc2f6d8caaba9The pain and bleeding may go away and you can continue to have a healthy pregnancy and baby. Or things may get worse and you go on to have a miscarriage.There is rarely anything a doctor, or you can do to protect the pregnancy. In the past bed rest was recommended, but there is no scientiﬁc proof that this helps at this stage.**Inevitable miscarriage**Inevitable miscarriages can come after a threatened miscarriage or without warning. There is usually a lot more vaginal bleeding and strong lower stomach cramps. During the miscarriage your cervix opens and the developing fetus will come away in the bleeding.**Complete miscarriage**A complete miscarriage has taken place when all the pregnancy tissue has left your uterus. Vaginal bleeding may continue for several days. Cramping pain much like labour or strong period pain is common this is the uterus contracting to empty.If you have miscarried at home or somewhere else with no health workers present, you should have a check-up with a doctor or midwife to make sure the miscarriage is complete.**Incomplete miscarriage**Sometimes, some pregnancy tissue will remain in the uterus. Vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal cramping may continue as the uterus continues trying to empty itself. This is known as an ‘incomplete miscarriage’.Similar to a complete miscarriage, there is heavy bleeding and severe pain during an incomplete miscarriage. Here too, the cervix is open. However, the pregnancy tissue may not be passed entirely, which can be revealed through an ultrasound.Your doctor or midwife will need to assess whether or not a short procedure called a ‘dilatation of the cervix and curettage of the uterus’ is necessary to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue. This is an important medical procedure done in an operating theatre.**Missed miscarriage**Sometimes, the baby has died but stayed in the uterus. This is known as a ‘missed miscarriage’.When a foetus dies quite early during pregnancy, and the tissue continues to remain in the mother’s womb, it is known as a missed miscarriage. The woman may feel all the symptoms of pregnancy if the placenta keeps releasing the essential hormones, but with time, all the signs of pregnancy may gradually decrease. The common symptoms of miscarriage may not be visible in some women while others could be subjected to vaginal discharge and cramping.If you have a missed miscarriage, you may have a brownish discharge. Some of the symptoms of pregnancy, such as nausea and tiredness, may have faded. You might have noticed nothing unusual. You may be shocked to have a scan and find the baby has died.If this happens, you should discuss treatment and support options with your doctor.**Recurrent miscarriage**A small number of women have repeated miscarriages. If this is your third or more miscarriage in a row, it’s best to discuss this with your doctor who may be able to investigate the causes, and refer you to a specialist.The occurrence of three or more pregnancy losses is defined as recurrent miscarriage. Only a small number of women have repeated miscarriages, in which case it is best to discuss the issue with the doctor or a specialist for taking necessary action.Chaitanya IVF is one of the [**Best IVF centers in Chandigarh**](https://ivf.chaitanyahospital.org/) and provides very affordable price IVF treatment in Chandigarh.

s,"Sorry this is so long, but I learned so much from all the birth stories on here and really want to share our experience. Hope it is encouraging and helpful to some of you! First, some pics:http://imgur.com/jXvC4Zuhttp://imgur.com/VY3GQwVhttp://imgur.com/iBHE2pYTL;DR: Two days and three nights of early labor; back labor due to position of baby, got an excellent epidural, great coaching from medical team and husband during 3 hours of pushing, finally popping out a 9 pound 10 ounce baby, sunny-side up. The details:Allison was born on Labor Day, but my labor actually started on the Thursday before. I was 41 weeks that day, and contractions started that evening - 10 min apart, uncomfortable but not painful. They lasted all night, some strong enough to wake me, and then disappeared in the morning. My mom had long early labor with all of her kids, so I pretty much expected something like this. We had an appt that morning where our OB estimated that she was 8.5 pounds. We had already discussed my desire to wait as long as possible before inducing, and he was totally supportive as long as baby and I were doing well. Contractions returned on Friday evening and didn't stop. They were still 10 min apart but getting more uncomfortable. I didn't sleep much that night. In the morning my husband and I went to tour an apartment complex, since our current lease is up in early October and we needed to find a new place ASAP. I was able to ignore/tolerate most of the contractions that day, but they were building slowly in intensity as well as frequency. I called the OB on call that evening to let her know what was going on and see if she thought I should go in. She said it sounded like I was just one of the unlucky ones who have really drawn-out early labor, and as long as my water hadn't broken and I was feeling good fetal movement, I could continue to labor at home. Ok by me - I knew if I went in to the hospital then, chances were good that I would end up with Pitocin and who knows what else, which I hoped to avoid.That night was pretty bad. I really couldn't sleep now, and lying in bed made me feel worse. I puttered around our apartment and took a few hot showers, which felt great.The next day (Sunday), things got serious. I lost my mucus plug (gross, but felt like a sign of progress!). Contractions were still only 6-7 min apart, but getting really intense and I started noticing significant back pain (first sign that she wasn't ideally positioned). I tried the Bradley method of lying on my side, trying to relax completely. My husband got in bed with me and let me rest my head on his chest and cuddle my way through them, which helped for a while. More showers. By the evening, I was really unhappy and called the OB on call again. She encouraged me to come in to the hospital to get checked.We got to the hospital around 8pm and they checked me - I was at 3 cm and almost completed effaced. I was happy with this - it meant active labor was finally going to start! I got admitted and did some walked the halls a bit with my husband. Several nurses smiled and said ""that's a good sign!"" as they passed me in the hallway leaning against my husband, huffing and puffing through contractions. I guess I looked like I was in sufficient pain :) By 1am I was in agony. My back pain had gotten so bad and I didn't think I could bear any more. Between contractions, my husband and I talked about an epidural. I had really wanted to avoid one, but told myself I should leave the option open in case of long labor/exhaustion (check and check. PLUS back labor). My husband reminded me that there's no shame in taking an epi and that was enough to help me over my disappointment and ask for one. BEST DECISION EVER. Seriously. I was able to sleep off and on for about 5 hours, and that was the boost I needed. Getting the epi wasn't fun - he had me sit cross-legged on the bed and lean forward over my huge belly, and be super still during contractions that were off the chart. But totally worth it.  Around 11am I was checked again, and was at 9.5 cm!! I was especially relieved because before the nurse checked me he said that if I hadn't made it to at least 7 cm, we should probably  talk about pitocin.We got ready to push. The nurses had already told me they were pretty sure she was not facing the right way, but no one seemed to think it would be a huge problem. We all hoped she had turned by that point, or would turn on the way down. I pushed for 3 hours, although the first hour was really more like practice pushes. I had no idea what I was doing, and had this half-baked, sleep-deprived idea that I should conserves energy and let my body do the work rather than straining (like when you have to poo). After about an hour of this and very little progress, a different nurse came in and started coaching me to ""pushpushpushpushpush!!"". I always thought that would be supremely irritating, but it totally worked for me. I should also add that my epidural was perfect - I could feel pressure everywhere I needed to and could move my legs and hips, but had very little actual pain. With excellent coaching from my nurses, OB, and husband I finally pushed her out. She was OP (sunny side up), which totally freaked my husband out (I don't blame him - I've seen pictures of it in birthing books and it's pretty freaky seeing a little squished-up face pop out).They put her on my chest immediately and I was surprised at how squishy she was. Turns out she was 9 pounds 10 ounces and 23 inches long!! No wonder it took so long! Everyone was saying how well I did and how difficult it must have been, which, of course, felt great. I felt so proud and happy and exhausted, and totally in love with my husband and in awe of what my body had just done. I was so happy to have this kid in my arms at last. Also, hungry. I ordered SO much food from the hospital menu afterwards :) I want to thank you all for being such a great community.

s,"Title sounds weird. I'll explain. My mother and I are not on the best terms. I am 20 years old, the youngest sibling of 3. My older siblings have moved out and essentially stopped contact with my mother, moving on with their lives. To put it simple, she can be very aggravating at times. A couple months ago, my BF and I agreed we'd like to move in together, as we spent months saving to do so. We had all our financial aspects in line. I also saw it as an opportunity to gain some privacy away from my mother.When I told her, she wouldn't have it. She guilted me saying she would be alone since she no longer has a job, and she specifically said ""you are not ready to move out. you may think you are an adult, but you are not, and as your mother, i think you need to stay here until I think you can handle being an adult."" (She has kind of been feeding me this narrative for a while and only now am I starting to see why I shouldn't have let it get to me.)After weeks of arguing, i gave in. My boyfriend took it as an opportunity for us to have some more time to save. But I digress. Yesterday I came home from a 10 hour work day to a sink filled with dirty dishes... she had made pizza. She claimed she had horrible back pain, begged me to do the dishes. Not wanting to argue, I did.  When i put them in the rack to dry, she said ""dont worry about letting them dry, i dont want to see them piled up, just put them in the pantry."" So fuck it, i did, and when i picked up the heavy, soaked pizza cutter, it slipped and the sharp edge fell right on the edge of my pinky toe, nearly slicing it off. After spending that whole night at the clinic getting stitches, i was informed of the hundreds of dollars the bill would be. At this point I was fed up. I told my mother she needed to pay it. I told her ""I know I dropped it, but like you said, im not an adult, and you refuse to let me make adult choices, so why should I have to pay this VERY adult bill? After all, this happened in your house that you forced me to stay in""She has been calling me childish and an asshole for thinking that they are related. She said ""see? this is exactly why youre not ready to live on your own."" But I cant see how that proves her point. I see it as giving her a taste of her own medicine. We've been arguing all afternoon and its getting nowhere. If im an asshole or not, if i have to pay the bill, im packing my backs and leaving. asap. AITA? TLDR; my mother guilted me to keep living with her despite me being 20 because she thinks im not mature enough to live on my own. So, while in her house, cleaning her dishes, I dropped a pizza cutter on my toe, nearly chopping it off. I told her she needs to pay my bill because im ""not adult enough to pay adult bills."" and shes saying im childish for thinking theyre the same thing.",0.503182,0.564723,0.0,0.0,0.591932,0.0,0.0,0.21554770318021202
c,"This is the best you can do about your mum/family, OP! If you still live with them, which looks like the case, it might be difficult to reinforce the consequences of bullying you, but you need to tell them each time that it's wrong, and you won't tolerate it. Now, about yourself, I read on other comments that, based on your height, you have a normal BMI. Still, I get you might get insecure about your body image, because it happens to all of us.  However, you need to understand that the perception we have of our bodies is extremely subjective, and it changes according to the information around us, regarding beauty stereotypes. I have a friend, who I have always thought had the perfect, swimsuit/fitness model-like body, who went on student exchange to Korea and developed an eating disorder there, in just 6 months. The media and societal pressure to be skinny was so heavy, that all her confidence and self love went down the drain, and she genuinely thought she ""had become"" fat there, even though that wasn't true at all. Also, any changes you want to make to your body should be born out of and driven by love for yourself, not hate.  I put on 7-8kg last year. I had been eating a lot and not excersicing enough, due to the academic pressure from university. This was during autumn/winter, so I hadn't really noticed a big change in my body, although I *could* feel clothes fit me differently.  The cold water bucket was when I weighed myself for a friend's class assignment, and found out I had gone from 52-53 kg to 60. When I got home that day, I took a shower and had a hard, objective look at my body. Definitely there had been a change, I just never realised, because I had been working hard on body positivity, but also too stressed to worry about that.  The hardest part for me was seeing how my stomach area was bulgy, flabby, and shapeless. All my body fat goes directly to my  tummy, and because of that, I had struggled all my life with not having a ""perfect, flat tummy"", so it hit hard. I got a grip of myself though, and tried to take it easy. ""It's not a big deal, this doesn't change my worth, and it's just a warning sign because I've been having unhealthy habits"". It was actually working, and I managed to not feel to bad about the weight I had put on, but everything came crashing down a few weeks later, when we started learning a new set of choreographies at my Polynesian dance group, and found out I was having a *really* hard time with the basic steps, got easily tired, and started having knee and back pain. Turns out I hadn't just put on weight, I had lost a lot of muscle, and with that, the strength I needed to dance. In the end, what hit me the hardest about putting on weight wasn't the change in how I looked, but realising I couldn't do well what I loved, which was dancing.  That was my ""wake-up call"". I started working on losing that extra fat and regaining the muscle I had lost. Not because I *hated* my looks, or *hated* not being able to dance properly, but because I *love* dancing, and I wanted to be better. That mentality made it so much easier on myself, because instead of dreading the big number on the scale or getting frustrated at the dance sessions, I celebrated each little progress I had (not having knee pain after a session, smoother movements, more endurance, etc.), which in turn gave me the motivation to keep going.  With this I don't want to tell you that you have to lose weight, but that, if you decide to do it, it doesn't have to be because you hate yourself, but because you love yourself, and no one has a say on it, but yourself 💕",0.606987,0.553921,0.0,0.773372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22916666666666666

Functions such as rising from sitting, straightening from bending position, walking up stairs or on a hill, and running.It supports the pelvis and trunk, which is vital when a person is standing on one leg.➡️https://youtu.be/ODbIwaP6jV8 The gluteal muscles are a group of three muscles which make up the buttocks: the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and gluteus minimus. The three muscles originate from the ilium and sacrum and insert on the femur. The functions of the muscles include extension, abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation of the hip joint.The iliopsoas muscle is a composite muscle formed from the psoas major muscle, and the iliacus muscle. The psoas major originates along the outer surfaces of the vertebral bodies of T12 and L1-L3 and their associated intervertebral discs. The iliacus originates in the iliac fossa of the pelvis.[1]The iliopsoas is classified as an ""anterior hip muscle"" or ""inner hip muscle"".[1] The psoas minor does contribute to the iliopsoas muscle.The iliopsoas is the prime mover of hip flexion, and is the strongest of the hip flexors (others are rectus femoris, sartorius, and tensor fasciae latae). The iliopsoas is important for standing, walking, and running.[1] The iliacus and psoas major perform different actions when postural changes occur.Sitting for long periods can lead to the gluteal muscles atrophying  through constant pressure and disuse and tightness on the iliopsoas.. This may be associated with (although not necessarily the cause of) lower back pain, difficulty with some movements that naturally require the gluteal muscles, such as rising from the seated position, and climbing stairs.So strengthening these   muscles with its minor and major roles to help support our hips , back , knees and thighs .

Kettlebell swings are a great way to get your heartrate up and train the entire posterior chain for better posture and less risk of back pain. Just get someone to show you the proper form once. If you want to work out at home, I suggest installing a pull-up bar in a doorway for pull-ups, chin-ups, then do pushups, air squats and burpees. 1 minute each exercise, 30 seconds rest time, and you ll be done in 10-12 minutes. If you care to, invest in a kettlebell (since you have done some training before, try the 8kg range at the gym and see if it fits, you dont outgrow them too quickly) or a set of dumbbells with adjustable weight plates, and thats about it. &amp;#x200B;",0.545291,0.534385,0.767143,0.538327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4178082191780822
c,"In high school, freshman year,  went home to my dad's and had a slight twinge of pain in my lower back but  thought nothing of it. That was a friday night and by monday morning I could no longer stand up straight. Stayed home from school for a few days and thought it was just a pulled muscle but the pain was intense, like someone stabbing a redhot blade from my lower back all the way down to the tops of my feet.  Dad took me to a nurse practitioner and she claimed it was as expected,  a pulled/sprained muscle.  This was my dads week (on off custody between parents during their horrific divorce, too long to post really cause I could write a book on it). Parents take me to a chiropractor for a few months and things got worse and pain reached level 11. After the treatments I could barely walk and the tears would run down my face from the pain, being a male teen it took a lot to cry in the middle of public places leaving these sessions. Chiropractic doc suggests mri and there's the problem...I was born with a narrow spinal canal in my lower back which was exacerbating a herniated disc between my L4-L5 vertebrae.  That bulge then pressed on my sciatic nerve pulsing insane amounts of pain.  Months later in the summer (I couldnt miss anymore school without being held back, despite keeping my grades up) I had surgery and they fixed the disc....spent 5 days in ICU to ensure everything was good to go and they stood me up and it hurt but this pain was different. Gone was the slicing pain down the backs of my legs and in its place was just surgery pain, the cut and swelling etc... but hey morphine is a hell of a drug. Spent the next two weeks at home with a walker (""speedy""my dad and sisters joked, we just moved in with my step mom a few months earlier...when I couldnt lift anything, haha success at laziness) Had a few mishaps with slips and it hurt...the sudden shock would bring back the slicing pain.  I can remember the first day I woke up and put my feet on the ground and had for the first time in nearly a year no twinge of any sort of pain, I stood up and still no pain, 1 step, 2, 3, and 4, now I am using my stride with no pain. I stop and think and without hesitation...I sprinted down the hallway into the living room and I remeber the most intense happiness rushing over me as I realized that the pain was truly gone as tears of relief washed down my face and I remember my dad coming out of the bedroom hearing my now sobs (I went through hell during their divorce/early childhood) and he just hugged me and started crying himself. (Crying now irl,  I haven't thought about this in awhile) It was done. Pain was over.  Physical therapy was amazing thanks to the amazing people I had working with me.

c,"I decided it was a good time to call work so I did once I got my hands on a phone. My boss didn't seen too happy that was calling 30 mins late and saying that I couldn't come to work today. His annoyed voice changed to surprise and sympathy when I told him I was hit by a truck and was in the hospital. He wished me good luck and hoped that I was okay before I told him I would keep him updated. Next I decided to call my mother. This, ladies and gentlemen, was a terrible mistake. If you get in an accident, DO NOT CALL YOUR MOTHER. Call your father first, and tell him to call your mother. Her voice was very non-chalaunt at first as well but once the words 'accident' and 'hospital' made it through the phone line her words weren't even audible. I tried to say that everything was okay and I was perfectly fine but I could have told her I won the lottery at that point and she wouldn't have absorbed any more information. Through the crying I heard 'there in 5' or something along those lines so I figured they were on the way. Next I called my girlfriend who thought I was joking and didn't believe me for a solid 3 minutes. After she finally realized I wasn't messing around she came straight to the hospital. Once she got there she said she shouldn't have even been driving because she doesn't remember a thing she was in so much shock.  Once everyone got there and realized I was semi-okay they seemed to calm down. I was just laying on the bed on my side, talking and smiling with minimal pain. About 2 hours after I got hit the pain started to come around, the shock started to wear off. The nurse gave me some drugs but it got pretty intense before it got better. After about 3 hours at the hospital I went for a few X-rays. I forced them to let me walk (quite slowly mind you) to the X-ray room.  Once we got the X-rays back the doctor determined that I had a compression fracture on my L1 vertebrae. It was a small fracture but looking at the X-ray my vertebrae, which is supposed to be square, was now a little bit shorter on one side vs the other. My vertebrae was literally compressed on one side by a few milimeters. Since I did some pretty intense labour work for my job the doctor said I was done of that for pretty much ever. That's when the psychology of it all hit me like a ton of bricks. It was much more serious than I thought, I woudn't be going back to work on Wednesday. It turns out that when I hit the truck, my vertebrae was compressed into the seat of my bike and took the bulk on the force of the hit. (The seat of my bike actually exploded. Literally gone right off my bike.) Luckily the doctor said that with my back muscles being so strong from the labour work they took the bulk of the force and that it would have been a lot worse without them being so developed. Also, since I bent forward when I hit him, the front of my vetebrae was compressed and fractured, she said if I had of bent backwards when I was hit I would likely be paralyzed.  Looking back on it, as I do at least once a week, I think that if I had hit him any other way I would either be dead or paralyzed. I reacted perfectly and hit him just right so that it would do minimal damage. I couldn't imagine if I hit him straight on, head first.  About 5 hours after I got hit I walked out of the hospital and the next day picked up my back brace and stopped by work to tell em I wouldn't be back. Ever. The back brace was quite uncomfortable at first but I got around to liking it. It had 4 pieces of plastic set in a soft cloth case. It wrapped around my entire body and tightened with 4 straps. It was designed to essentially do what my back and ab muscles did: hold up my body. I was to wear it 24/7 for the first week and then just when I wasn't in bed every day after for 10 weeks. I couldn't bend over, twist, lift anything over 5 pounds, or do any sitting-up movements (to get out of bed for example).  The first 2 days I didn't feel all that bad. I was up and walking around a bit every few hours and many of my friends came to see me. That night though was the worst night of my life. I remember waking up around 3am in more pain than I have ever felt before. I could barely move, it felt as though every muscle in my body had tensed up; like I flexing every muscle in my body at the same time, just non-stop. The T3's they had given me really didn't do much at all at that point. Thankfully that only lasted a few days and I was able to start moving around again by the 6th day or so.  I was on bed rest for 2 weeks and with the back brace on I couldn't even get out of bed to use the bathroom. (no situps and the back brace really constricts your movement) Lucky for me my mother worked from home so she helped me get out of bed and I could walk to the bathroom just fine. My girlfriend was there every minute she wasn't working so she was my primary care taker, I really couldn't have gotten through it without her there. It was so frustrating to be literally helpless. I couldn't go to the bathroom, make any of my food, leave my bed, or even sit up to get more comfotable without help.  I recovered fairly quickly and was back in school (university) after about 2 1/2 weeks. I used a backpack that had wheels to carry my books around and could only sit for ~45 minutes at a time so it worked out pretty well. After 10 weeks the back brace came off and I started pysiotherapy. As you can imagine I was fairly fit before the accident but once I started pysio I couldn't even do a single sit up. I could barely get my head 4 inches off the floor. Amazing what happens when you don't use your core mucles for 10 weeks. After a few weeks of pysio I began doing my own workouts again and I was cleared to go back to work after 6 months. I returned the following summer to do 1 day per week and right now I'm almost fully recovered. I have some back pain here and there depending on what I'm doing or if I try to over work it but I think its not much more than a normal person would feel after strenuous actvity.  So yeah, that's my story. Some advice to all: walk your bike across intersections. You never know when someone won't see you. Also, when you are driving it is a natural to actively look for and avoid other cars. Try to get into the habit of looking for pedestrians and bikers.

c,"I'm really glad you wrote about this. No advice, just comiseration. I'm having separation anxiety, too, and it's nice to know I'm not alone. My baby is fine, the problem is totally me! He is 3 months old and I am head over heels for this long-awaited baby. I'm supposed to return to work soon, only part time at first, and was just sobbing about it. If I would rather stay home it's OK, I just really liked my career and it pays well (I realize this is a good problem to have and I'm sorry if I'm making anyone roll their eyes!). It's been ok to be away from my son for a few hours, but the thought of regularly being gone all day is so hard. I'm being treated for PPD and PPA and have made real progress in the last 6 weeks, but I'm not all better yet. I don't know what to do. A job like mine is rare and probably won't come around again, but my baby is even rarer. Yet when I'm home with him I'm often so tired and in pain (c-section and related back pain) I find myself counting the hours until my husband comes home, so I can have help. My baby is fantastic, so it shouldn't be this hard. It's nice to see all the support and kindness here. I hope you find the right answer for you!

s,"Not sure where to begin. I'm 17, and my life has irrevocably been thrown down the shitter and I can't possibly see it getting any better. I'm only a week away from graduating high school, and I was born into a rather fortunate family. I should be happy with my life right? Everything else has utterly gone to shit. I have absolutely zero friends, only just acquaintances who don't talk to me outside of group chats/classroom conversations. I've only ever dated one person, who left me after 5 months, who i still can't fucking get over after 3 years. I have nothing special about myself. Every skill that I remotely enjoy I'm awful at, and every time I try something new I fail miserably at it and NEVER improve. I've tried guitar, art, writing, video games, working on cars, and so many other little things I couldn't possibly list them all. All of them have one similarity, and it's that I'm fucking horrible at all of them. I'm not attractive in any way and I have more health problems than I can count. Someone could name literally any part of me and I could tell them why I hate it. Face? Ugly and asymmetrical. Height? Horrible back pain and scoliosis. Teeth? Crooked, yellow, and decayed from years of neglect. My brain seems to be equally as fucked. The first time I had a mental breakdown where I actually became suicidal was in 7th grade. Since then, for 6 years I've been struggling with whatever fucking mental disorder I have. I'm not smart at all, I was one of those kids who was put into a ""gifted"" class in elementary school and spent the rest of their life thinking that everything would be easy. Whatever work ethic I've had has been completely ruined by me being able to bullshit my way through school, and the pandemic easily made this worse. I could elaborate on any of these things, and more, but I don't feel like writing out every detail of my life here.  As for my ex, (Call her J) I think this whole situation deserves it's own paragraph.  We've known each other for about 5 or 6 years now. We were only together for about 5 months during freshman year, which I know is fucking pathetic to still not get over after 3 years. Before I met her I had almost 0 personality and I rarely talked to anyone, even my own parents. She was really the first person to actually give a shit about my existence. She is genuinely the kindest person I know and she still talks to me even after 3 years of my not getting over anything. After we broke up I nearly killed myself on multiple different occasions and seeing J with someone else fucking broke me. She's gone through so much shit herself but my stupid ass just wont leave her alone. She keeps trying to trust me with things and she'll tell me about her problems but I always end up making it about myself and it always reminds me of when we were together. Every time we get closer I always think it's because she likes me again and I'll end up asking and fucking it all up again. We would regularly have like 5 hour long phone calls and we would sit next to each other after school ends and go get food and I loved all of it. Even just as friends it still made me so fucking happy. But I always misinterpret it as J wanting to get back together and I end up just fucking things up for everyone. I don't know why she hasn't just left. She could easily just never speak to me again and I have no clue why she stays. She has other friends, she has other people who care about her. Don't get me wrong, I want to stay with her. She's the only person I ever talk to and probably the only person I ever will. I can't make new friends easily and if I do I almost always stop talking to them because I have no idea how to speak to another human being besides her. It hurts so fucking much living like this and I know it will just get worse as time goes on. No amount of therapy or time will help with this and at this point I just want to end it the easy way. I genuinely have nothing else to live for and I just want to stop being in pain. I just want J to be happy but I know I hurt her every time I argue with her and I know it will be easier for her when I'm gone. I know some of you will just say to get over it and that there's more to life than relationships but this has become such a significant part of MY life that I wouldn't really be living without her. And with everything else that's going on I doubt it would be very pleasant to keep living. My father keeps a gun in his car and I think I'm just going to use that. It should be painless and I think everyone else will be much happier when I'm gone.  Again, I can elaborate on a lot of these things and there's a lot I haven't written here for privacy's sake.",0.581177,0.578222,0.742375,0.0,0.563611,0.0,0.0,0.18874172185430463

s,"Male, 31, nonsmoker, very occasional drinker, 5 foot 10, 155 pounds, 200mg zoloft for OCD and occasional prilosec.Up until December my only diagnosis was OCD. Since then I've been diagnosed with acid reflux, gastritis, and a very small hiatal hernia. In April I had a clean abdominal and pelvic CT, Upper Endoscopy (outside of hernia, gastritis, and reflux), chest xray, and colonoscopy. I just had a 12 lead ECG that noted Sinus tachycardia (I was extremely nervous and in the ER. If you believe my fitbit, my resting heartrate is 77), Possible Left atrial enlargement, and Borderline ECG. How seriously should I take those results? Do I have a bad heart?I insisted on the upper endoscopy and colonoscopy because I had a positive fecal occult (fit) test I took at home. Possibly related to my frequent bloody noses?Edit: I forgot to add that I've had two cbc's. My red blood cell count was just barely high out of the normal range on the second one. On the first one my absolute neutrophils were just barely high. My Neutrophils to Lymphocytes was 80% to 13% of my wbc which I believe is an unusual ratio. The latest cbc had total lymphocytes of 1.0 k/million. The only other notable things were calcium, protein, and glucose all just high outside the normal range.Since the middle of December I've had back pain that is usually dull, and a 3 on the pain scale. It is mostly towards the middle and upper part of my back. I most often feel it under my right shoulder blade and towards my right flank, but lately I'll have a little bit of pain on the left as well under the shoulder and near the flank. Also, recently I've noticed the pain directly on my spine in the middle of the shoulder blades.. I feel it at night and the late morning most often. Sometimes I feel it when I wake up and sometimes it's completely gone. I feel it everyday to some extent. It may have gotten slightly worse over these 5 months, but not obviously so. I've also had abdominal pain (that seems to have gotten a little better since the upper gi). That pain was focused a couple inches above my belly button. My wife felt a ""popping"" and something out of place under my right shoulder blade and thinks that the right-middle part of my back is slightly swollen compared to the left side.Another symptom that I've had is recurrent bloody noses. For years I've gotten them in the winter, but this year it was every day. 95% of the time it was my right nostril. It seems to have slowed down with the weather, but I had my first one in a week today.Most recently i started feeling slightly faint when I've stood up suddenly. A couple times I felt like I had trouble concentrating at work and had brain fog. This is new and occurred over the past two weeks.Finally, I want to admit that I have severe OCD that was dormant for the past 5 years. In the past it was related to my health, but never to this extent. I don't want that to color everything you think about this, but I also don't want to mislead you.Where should I go from here? I've had more doctor's appointments (for both mental and physical health) over the past 5.5 months than I had in the previous 10 years. I feel like I'm trapped without an understanding of what's going on. I'm terrified of pancreatic cancer (missed on the CT?), brain cancer (no tests, do I need an MRI or head CT?), lung cancer, MS, and more.Thanks for reading and I hope you can respond if you have any insight to provide.",0.0,0.616931,0.793652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21462639109697934
c,"My advice is to micro-dose THC gummies. I have a friend that has PTSD and severe back pain. He takes 5-10 mg (gummies) every 1 to 1.5 hours. You could start at 2.5mg then go 5.0mg if you find you need more...and go from there. The key is to find the minimum effective dose. Go low and slow. You want it to work all day while allowing you to be productive and clearheaded throughout the day. This works for him well. It may require you to cut gummies in half or quarters. By keeping your dose low, you will prevent tollerance buildup thus you will need less, saving you money and making daily activities safer as well. If you have questions, please ask.

s,"So, in May of 2012, my husband and I decided we were ready, and stopped birth control. I have never been a particularly healthy person, with nasty allergies that kept me on year round antihistamines, frequent steroids, and just constantly feeling sick. For the whole first year, I tracked, planned, temped and scrutinized. Nothing. In July of 2013, a glimmer of hope, a very faint positive on a wondfo...only to end in blood and pain a few days later. The chemical seemed to spur on some latent sciatica, the worst pain I've ever felt, and I was put back on prednisone. Between the back pain and my allergies/asthma, I stayed on it for several more months, and gained a lot of weight. Though the doctors all said it would not prevent a pregnancy, I knew better. My body was an extremely hostile environment. Nothing was going to grow there. Still, having spent 18 months trying and being over 30, my husband and I decided to get some testing done...his SA was completely normal, I had a day 3 ultrasound that showed normal everything and even some good stuff happening in my ovaries. We scheduled an hsg, but cancelled it the next day as we wanted to give it a little more time. Even though my moms conceived me via insemination, I've always wanted as little medical intervention as possible for myself.Around then, we ran into a friend of a friend who saw my allergic misery and suggested paleo. Apparently it had really helped her. We always said we would try anything, so I researched, and jumped into a whole 30. 3 weeks in, I started noticing changes. My sense of smell was coming back...something I hadn't had in more than 15 years without the help of prednisone. I was feeling healthier, and by the end of our trial period, able to reduce or remove some of my nastier meds from the round. I decided to continue a strict paleo diet (no grains, dairy, sugar or beans) and my husband follows a less strict version (as he has literally no health issues)Here we are, 5 months later, and not only have I lost 25 lbs (a mere 10 away from my wedding weight!), but I'm also feeling great,  the headaches are gone, the allergies are here but manageable and improving, and on Thursday, I got a real, beautiful, BFP. I retested today and saw another, stronger one, something we didn't get last time. We are over the moon, even as we are terrified and cautiously hopeful :) Paleo isn't for everyone. I'm not suggesting it's some miracle cure and that everyone go on it. But, it was easier than I expected, and had more of a profound impact than I could have anticipated. There are a myriad of reasons women have a tough time conceiving, and whatever mine was, this seemed to have jogged it. Just wanted you all to know this success story :) Good luck and baby dust to all!! TL;DR paleo got me pregnant. ",0.585355,0.634823,0.709355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22924901185770752
c,"This is painfully similar to what I'm going through right now.  I recently moved to Seattle with my boyfriend and planned to come home and spend a month with my family over the holidays since we're very close and they had a hard time transitioning with my being across the country. My abuela (grandmother) helped raise me and my sister and acted as my main confidant for most of those years (still does on a good day).  About a week into my time home, December 11, my abuela called saying she was going to the ER because her back pain was too severe and she could hardly walk. We had seen her three days prior and despite the soreness in her back, she seemed healthy as always. We later got a call that she had pathological fractures in her spine and that they were suspecting cancer.  Over the next one to two weeks, while translating for my abuela (she only speaks Spanish) and helping her walk to the bathroom, we would come to find that she has stage four adenocarcinoma that originated in the lung and spread to her liver, spine, and parts of her brain. I'm now here until the end of February helping my mom care for her here at home while we start with chemotherapy. The deterioration of a loved one who took care of you for so long is not easy, especially on the bad days where there's nothing you can do to help. I can definitely relate to that and while I find some solace that someone somewhere is going through something similar, I don't wish it on anyone else.  I'm sorry to hear about your grandmother's prognosis, we're going through with chemo and staying as positive as we can while leaving her care up to her.  I will say that focusing on timestamps given by doctors is probably the last thing you and your family should do.  When speaking to my mom, one oncologist drew a line and said, ""You see at one end we have the beginning of life. And at the other side, the end of life. But nowhere in this line do you have time to fit in death."" It's corny, but I do think it has truth.  C elebrate the time you have with her, do your best to make her laugh. Hug her a lot and tell her stories about your life and see if she has any to relate to. Make every moment the best damn day, month, years that you can. Be glad that you can be there, because there are so many others in the same situation who can't be there for their loved ones. I hope this can help? You aren't alone.

s,I’m not sure if what I’m experiencing is just anxiety or if this is the real thing.I keep checking my oximeter anytime I feel short of breath and it has been 98%+ each time. So not sure if that’s just a panic attack or what. I have had moments where I felt warm then it went away. I now have a thermometer but no fever. I do feel tired but I am stressed out about all this and haven’t been sleeping the best. No cough. If anything I kind of want to cough and if I do I have to force it. When I force it- sounds like a bronchitis cough. Only can get a more loose cough if I take my inhaler. I have had some chest heaviness and mostly back pain (more sore than anything almost like pleurisy) that comes and goes.This started a week ago. Doesn’t feel any worse but seems to stay the same. Off and on. I’m concerned I may have it and it’s turned into walking pneumonia or going to hit me like a ton of bricks eventually.

Write down what activirties you've done leading up to the pain flareups (lifting, twisting etc) and also write down what you've done to make the pain better (stretches, walking etc).

s,"Hello everyone, I wanted to make this post because I’ve had a really rough time in the days since my consultation (which was 3 days ago, on the 9th) and I am feeling very self conscious about it. Some background information: I am nearly 22, 5’1, 135 lbs, and I wear a 34H (UK sized). I lost about 40 pounds in 2019 and have kept the weight off. Before I lost weight, I was wearing a much larger bra size. Now that I have lost weight my breasts are smaller but still very large and now I have a lot of extra skin and I feel even worse about their appearance now than I did before I lost the weight. I have had problems with back and neck pain and headaches since I was 15. My consult started smoothly with the staff giving me info about the procedure but then very quickly I was asked to undress and taken into a room for photos. Obviously I knew beforehand I’d have to undress but the process of doing that and then immediately going to have photos taken was so hard for me. I felt terrible while they were happening and after the nurse practitioner who took the photos left me alone to wait for the doctor I started crying and felt so emotional. I am just so ashamed of my body and so exhausted by the weight and it all caught up to me and I was so sad and worried. Eventually I kind of stopped and was wearing a mask obviously so it wasn’t super obvious. The doctor came in and was very nice and told me that they would submit my case to insurance and explained that here in Texas incurable typically want to take 500g out of each breast and that he would have to estimate how much today during my examination. When he started measuring me I got emotional again and he asked if I was crying and I basically started sobbing. Looking back I feel terrible about this. I explained to him that I felt ashamed and he was very nice and reassuring and helped talk me down. But then he told me he estimated that he would be taking 400 out of one and 450 out of the other and I felt worse again thinking about the insurance requirements. I held it together until I went back out to my car and then basically cried all the way home. The pandemic has been very hard on my depression and self esteem anyway and since the appointment I have felt more self conscious than ever, and my back pain has been very intense the past couple days, exacerbating the feelings. I feel terrible about myself and am sick with worry over whether insurance will approve. I cannot keep living like this. I guess I am just posting this to see if anyone had a similar experience or if anyone has any advice in regards to managing emotions about this. Also, if anyone with BCBS insurance in Texas has anything they could share about their process I would really appreciate it.

s,"This is going to be a very, very long post so I apologize in advance. I'll do a tl;dr at the bottom. I want to also say that I support the use of IUDs and I am not saying no one should use them, just sharing my experience. I would however politely request that you don't reply to say that I should try again, etc. Thank you.In late July I had the Paragard IUD inserted at Planned Parenthood because of my issues with hormonal birth control. The experience was far more painful than I thought it would be. I was a bit anxious and tense going in, but not badly so. The actual insertion was one of the worst pains I've ever felt, and surprised me so much I got chills, and couldn't stop shivering. I had read about many women experiencing moderate to severe pain but I guess I thought it wouldn't happen to me. Despite the pain, overall I felt that if worked out for me, that I would do it again, so I had a positive outlook and I was happy.My main concern wasn't about insertion but rather about what happened after. I had pretty normal bleeding and cramping for post-IUD insertion, and I figured things were going well. Around the 4th day I noticed strange looking flecks of *something* in the discharge when I wiped. It was grayish and didn't disintegrate when rubbed in toilet tissue like dried blood does. I was concerned but they weren't very large, about the size of tomato seeds, so I thought I'd wait and see. Around 3am on the 5th day I woke up with back pain, and strong cramping. I decided to check my strings. They seemed like they were normal, but when I removed my finger I found much larger pieces of this mysterious stuff this time, around 5-7mm in length. One was pale grayish pink and white-ish, and the other was more grayish, like it was older. These larger pieces looked much more, well, fleshy-looking. I tried googling and found few reports about something like this happening, so I was concerned. I didn't have an excessive amount of blood so I decided to wait for the appointment with my primary care I had around 10am that morning. I put the whatever-it-was in a small zipped baggy to take with me and put it in the fridge. Weird and gross but I wanted to bring proof, you know? The fridge unfortunately didn't help much with keeping it looking like it did when it came out of me.I saw the nurse practitioner who briefly consulted with gynecology. Gynecology said it looked like skin. Um. Okay. This shit is coming out of my vagina, from up inside of me. As far as I know, there's no ""skin"" up in there. The NP then asked if I was ""experiencing any dryness."" I felt insulted and emphasized that I was sure this was not blood, discharge, or skin. She suggested I return to PP to ask their opinion so I did so.At PP I didn't see a clinician, I saw a medical assistant who had relayed my concern to the clinician. She said the clinician wasn't concerned, that it looked like dried blood, even after I had emphasized that I was sure that it wasn't. To paraphrase, the MA said ""every woman has discharge and blood, and these are also normal after having an IUD inserted"". I emphasized that I know discharge and blood are to be expected, but that at 27 I knew what blood looked like, and that this stuff didn't disintegrate like dried blood does when it's rubbed. She kept repeating that discharge and blood is normal, the clinician wasn't concerned, etc. I felt dismissed, embarrassed and stupid. She also said (again paraphrasing) ""if you really want us to examine you, we will, but the clinician really isn't concerned about blood because it's normal, and you should come in when you aren't bleeding so it would be easier to test you for a yeast infection or BV."" No one mentioned checking for placement with an ultrasound or that it could be expelling. I declined because at that point I was upset and barely concealing it, and very tense and I didn't think I had the emotional strength to handle a pelvic exam while I was in pain and trying to control myself. I told her I didn't want to be seen as a problem patient so I would have to decline. I passed less tissue over the next few days, but I wasn't feeling that great. I was very, very crampy and the cramps were more intense in certain positions like laying flat on my back or on my side. Side was slightly better. I couldn't sleep well because of this. NSAIDs weren't helping.  I was anxious, felt creeped out at the foreign object inside me, afraid to masturbate for fear of pain, had a dead sex drive, and felt nauseous whenever I would check the strings because of the foreign-object-creepiness factor. I kept telling myself to push through this, grow up, and stop being a baby. So I did my best to tolerate it, meditated, took warm showers, engrossed myself in hobbies, and tried to self-soothe as much as I could.At around 12am on August 5th I was finally sick enough of not being able to get a good night's sleep that I took an old codeine I had squirreled away just in case. It severely irritated my stomach and was very very painful, and that's what I ended up going to the ER for. My mom drove me there at around 1:30am. At the ER they asked what I had taken the codeine for, and they said we should definitely check on my IUD to see that it was positioned correctly, wasn't expelling, etc. A nurse that was assigned to me said that she was surprised that PP didn't take it seriously and do an ultrasound to check for placement to make sure it hadn't moved. As far as she knew, that was standard procedure for something like this. After a urine test, CT scan with contrast, an abdominal ultrasound, and a vaginal ultrasound, they confirmed that it was expelling and was inside my cervix. They gave me an injection of dilaudid and it was the first time I had felt any pain relief.The ER doctor assigned to me was very kind and understanding and had a great bedside manner. I asked if he would be willing to take it out and he agreed. I had to hoist my hips up onto a plastic bed pan because the beds in the ER weren't equipped for pelvic exams. It was slightly awkward and humiliating but I wanted the thing out of me. I told the doctor I was really tense and anxious because my insertion was very painful, and he said he would give me some lorazepam after we removed it. As soon as he inserted the speculum, it was painful, and I was crying and shaking because I was too tense to relax my muscles at all. It was over in probably 30 seconds, and removal hurt, but not as bad as insertion. I felt immediate physical and mental relief and thanked him profusely while I was still crying. He squeezed my hand and said something to the effect that he was sorry this had happened to me and PP should have been responsible for this. I don't quite remember verbatim because of the dilaudid and the lorazepam I got shortly after.I've been debating about whether or not I should file a complaint with Planned Parenthood. I fully support them and what they do, and know that especially in the poor border town where I live, their services are greatly needed. I've put it off because I was hoping I would just get over it, and also because I feel like it was somehow my fault because of my anxiety. I've had lingering anxiety as well as nightmares where I relive everything. It's triggered my depression again after I had been in remission for a few months. I know my anxiety had an effect on my experience, but I truly feel dismissed, stupid, and embarrassed. I've been trying to start an online art business to support myself since I deal with chronic but non life-threatening illness, and this has greatly interrupted that. This experience has also completely changed my relationship with my body. My sex drive has tanked, I don't enjoy masturbation, and I called it off with the FWB I was involved with. I don't know the best avenue to take if I complain to make sure that I'm heard and met with compassion. I don't even know what I want as a result of complaining. What would filing a complaint even do? idk. I just wanted to share my experience, in case this has happened to anyone else, so that other people would know they aren't alone. If anyone has any advice or kind words I would really appreciate both.tl;dr: I passed small bits of pink, white-ish, and gray fleshy stuff after Paragard was inserted at Planned Parenthood. Primary care and PP both dismissed my concerns, saying it was ""skin"" or ""dried blood."" Later went to the ER where they checked my IUD and expressed some concern that PP had not decided to do an ultrasound to check positioning. I'm dealing with lingering emotional effects from the pain and lack of compassion. I'm apprehensive about filing a complaint because I feel like it's my fault due to anxiety, and also out of fear of being dismissed again.

c,"Exercise.  As you noted, your back problems started again when you were no longer keeping fit.  Everyone needs to keep at least a base level of physical fitness -- literally anyone who is not in a coma or otherwise bedridden can do so.  Do exercises that strengthen your core and back.  Yoga is great and can be done in a short amount of time in the comfort of your home.  Deadlifts are great but *find someone who will show you how to do them correctly* or at least get Starting Strength, a book which is often discussed on /r/fitness.  These and other exercises that will keep you as that ""base level"" of fitness can be done with dumbbells which take close to zero storage room and can be used, again, in the comfort of your own home.  (Yes, you won't be building up to 400 pound deadlifts, but you'll be engaging and working the muscles and I'd rather see someone do *some* lifting, correctly, than none.) Maintain correct posture.  When tall and always hunching over stuff, like kitchen counters, that are made for folks 8+ inches shorter than us, we tend to round our shoulders.  Don't do it -- it's a recipe for upper-to-mid back pain.  Same with walking correctly with your core engaged -- good core muscles mean you likely won't have lower back issues. These are easy things that the most busy person can fit in.  Walking and standing correctly take no extra time.  A little exercise can be fit in while watching TV or something, and yes you're halfassing it, but the person who halfasses it is going to be more fit than the dude who goes ""ah fuck it"" and puts his feet up on the couch.  The halfassing person will also notice they are getting stronger or more fit, albeit very slowly, and maybe be inspired to progress to three-quarter-assing or beyond.

s,"A couple months ago, a girl I use to hang out with a lot died from an apparent heroin overdose.  She was found with her 2 young children unresponsive.

It's illegal in the state she lives in, so I guess It's not like I could do much. Idk, It's just really important to me that kratom stays legal so this doesn't continue to happen.

c,"I think it’s important to point out that the plastic surgeon is trained in the repair and treatment of trauma, burns, hands, congenital disorders, and reconstruction. All of these require meticulous skill and are life-changing for their patients. And we general surgeons are ever grateful to have a plastic surgeon by our side who can fix the giant holes we make in cutting cancers out. It would be difficult/impossible without them. Cosmetic surgery is a portion of training, but even many surgeries that are “cosmetic” in fact serve a function. I have patients at the VA who cannot see/drive because of eyebrow ptosis-quick blepharoplasty can fix that. Breast reductions can help back pain. For the few surgeons who pursue solely cosmetic surgeries, I’d argue that one’s self-worth is too often tied to appearances (whether or not it should, that is how it is).

I also smoke for distraction of my chronic back pain so i’ve been feeling the main much worse this week. are there ways to make the withdraws go away or am i just gonna have to wait it out? i was also thinking about ordering a pack of CBD cigarettes to my house but i’ve never tried cbd before.  will cbd do anything? i’m sometimes lost w/o weed (especially cus i’m sitting at home all day with barley any weed to smoke😩),0.0,0.681802,0.848678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3765432098765432
s,"You might not think of your feet as a significant contributor towards the overall health of your body. The fact is that among external aspects, your feet are the hardest working part of your body. You can prevent, hip, knee and back pain by taking proper care of your feet.Following are 5 exercises that will help improve your balance, help prevent pain and strengthen your feet.Top Presses:Before engaging in any exercise you should warm up your feet, just like any other body part. Top presses will warm up your feet. They are a low impact warm-up with a relaxing movement. Stand straight and bend your knees slightly. Use your toes to grip the floor and hold this position while counting to three. Release slowly and do 10 reps. Do this three times a day.Toe Walking:This exercise will help you strengthen the muscles in your toes. It will also help you strengthen the muscles and ligaments surrounding the balls of the feet. To do this exercise, stand on your tiptoes and walk ahead for 20 seconds. After completing the walk, take rest for about 15 seconds. Repeat the exercise 5 more times.Note: Perform this exercise twice a day for best results.Ankle Circle:The mobility and flexibility of ankles is very important. Tight and restricted ankles cause the body to compensate for the flaws, which can result in joint and muscle pain in entire body. Tight ankles may cause knee, back or hip pain.Put your back on the floor. Extend one leg over your head. Now rotate the ankle of the extended leg in the clockwise direction. Do this ten times. Then repeat the same exercise with the same leg in the anti-clockwise direction ten times. Switch the leg and repeat.Resisted Flexion:You can target the small muscles in your feet with this exercise. These muscles are important in maintaining the balance. You can prevent injuries by strengthening these muscles.You will require an exercise band to perform this exercise. Straighten your feet while sitting on the floor. Use a chair or a bedpost to wrap an exercise band around it. Then place the band on top of your feet. Remain seated on the floor and slide back. Stop when you feel tension in the band. Flex your foot backwards. Hold this position for a count to 5, release slowly. Repeat the same movement 10 times.From site: http://en.instiks.com/pin/3839/",0.548484,0.521722,0.615225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20865139949109415

c,"Shitty time in my life but here it goes.. Found 90x10mg opana IR to sniff from my dead uncle third year of college. Got addicted in ways, but got through any withdrawls quick using some other drugs. I would wake up, not remember anything because i mixed it with ativan, and look on my desk. Yup big bottle of pink pills right there for me, never gonna run out. Just got back from xmas break and was at my own pad in University. Had roommates. Anyhow, I would get up, maybe from the nausea and maybe get sick while i ran the shower. Eat some cereal, feel OK, go smash a pill and come back out to my buddies and take a bong load with everyone. I was just on a different level.  I was nodding, sleeping sitting up for hours, breaking shit, knocking things over, making a mess. Milk in the cupboard and cereal in the fridge. Stupid shit. Wake up and not remeber the previous day, again. Miss meetings. Didnt surf or skateboard (my loves). Anyhow my roommates knew what was going on, they didnt even have to ask. I gave my pills up to my roommate and then went in his room and took them back without him knowing. Low stuff.  Anyhow I made it through the semester barely. My advisor i believe caught me nodding off in class a few times, though never said anything to me. I got home and had a tough time going to doctors and worrying my parents saying I had back pain, which I do. I would get meds (vicodin).  The lowest I've felt-- when I woke from a nod where I sat in my car to text a message. My dad was with my neighbor and he yelled ""GTFO of the car!"" and I woke. I got out and heard my neighbor getting off the phone with 911. They thought I was dead or something.  I wish I still had those pills because nothing else helps my pain, but I live through it and it makes me miserable, sometimes. Ill take it I guess. TL;DR- Pain pills made me lose several months of my life. ",0.0,0.607406,0.913111,0.0,0.552263,0.0,0.0,0.273972602739726

s,"24, F, 5'8, 165 lbs. in late 2009 (i think, or maybe super early 2010) i threw my back out pretty badly- at the time my doctors thought it was an overuse injury from the amount of dance i was doing (4x a week, super out of shape and chubby teenager with no idea how to use core muscles- easy to see how a bad injury could happen) and at their advice after seeing my frankly appalling MRI, i did physical therapy and took a ton of aleve until the pain went away enough that i could function.fast forward to today- just got back new MRIs of my lumbar spine. this injury has acted up a lot over the past 7 years and i really reached my limit recently- i have a pretty high pain tolerance but it would get so bad i couldn't sit, at all. holding a steady job was impossible. i worked retail for a while, which was doable because i was just standing constantly, but i still had tons of days where id be grimacing through pain and trying to subtly lean on the cash register to get some relief. currently i'm living with my parents and finishing my associates degree. i graduated highschool in 2011 and had a lot of issues with college thanks to having to constantly miss class due to back pain- also due to depression, which i developed after this injury (probably not a coincidence)i think it's relevant to mention that i did complete the physical therapy i did when i first slipped the discs- i ""graduated"" or whatever and continued to do exercises at home, pretty religiously for years afterward. unfortunately whenever i'd get my period i'd get bad back pain and have to stop exercising, which would result in a minor flareup requiring aleve and rest- usually only a few days though. i did try one more physical therapy attempt in 2015 with a new office, as my pain had acted up again really badly after one of these minor flareups- i gave up pretty early on since it didn't seem to be doing much, and from then until this past march i just ignored the fact that some days i couldn't walk or sit. anyways, recently id been just tired of dealing with this injury that didn't seem to have improved much, hence the new doctor and mri order. but to my surprise- it hasn't improved at ALL. old vs new mri - https://imgur.com/gallery/NoPD8 at the time of the injury i was offered surgery, cortisone shots, or aleve and pt. at the advice of my doctor i did aleve and pt, which needless to say i'm pretty fucking pissed about that at this point- in retrospect it seems frankly irresponsible to not push cortisone shots at the very least considering how extreme that one disc is. i had no idea the severity of the injury until years later when i compared my mri to others id found online showing herniated discs and like, laughed. i was in so much pain trying to do physical therapy that every other session was basically just fixing my back enough that i could walk without pain. my new doctor that ordered these MRIs had said he thought i had ""sensitive discs"" after i described my pain- that being severe pain (kind of a dull stabbing pain? it's hard to remember unless it's happening) in my right quadricep, and moderate dull, radiating pain across my lower back, which tends to act up after exercise and prolonged sitting. he encouraged me to do everything my first doctor had said i should never do, ever again for as long as i live (including running and high impact exercise) so i could ""desensitize"" the discs, which to me sounded like i'd just end up in the hospital. he also didn't bat an eyelash when i told him on average when my back was acting up i was taking 8 otc aleve every 24 hours, so idk what it would take to make him think a patient is having an excessive amount of pain lol. needless to say i'll be seeking a second opinion if he doesn't change his diagnosis after seeing the MRI, but to be honest i feel pretty depressed about the whole situation- i know doctors hate when patients come in citing stuff like web md and pushing for a specific treatment, but im really, really desperate, and i really want surgery. i know it wont magically fix all my problems but i just feel like it must be better than doing nothing, and i'm obviously not a doctor but it seems like if they were to just cut off that massive, bulging part of the disc it would probably fix 90% of my issues tbh.id already prepared to spend the rest of my life being careful of my back, and now i'm honestly just despair ridden and worried that ill never be able to hold a steady job because of this? i think i did a pretty good job trying to take care of it (using proper lifting techniques, trying to use my core a lot) but i'm still in pain often enough that i can't even sew reliably (current source of income along with childcare- sitting at the sewing machine / on the floor isn't painful for whatever reason, i'm guessing because i can move around a lot, but i can't sew if anything other than lying down is excruciating!!!)i guess i'd interpreted what was actually increased pain tolerance as me having less pain, a sign that the discs had been like, shrinking back to their normal shape (i was told naproxen encouraged this but it clearly...didn't....) and had been dealing with the pain with this in the back of my head...idk. it also didnt help that everyone ive ever spoken to who hasnt seen the mri has kind of implied that its my fault that i have pain still since it just must mean i'm not keeping up with physical therapy, and just being bad and irresponsible about how i treat my back. which is kind of fucked up in my opinion considering i got this injury when i was 17 and most people didnt have to spend their twenties constantly worrying about their lumbar health anyways any advice is super appreciated, and sorry for the long winded post. not really taking the new MRIs well and feeling kind of despair ridden at the moment, to be honest.

I’ve tried physical therapy, chiro, yoga, and epidurals with varying degrees of success treating my L5/S1 pain. After about four months of low pain and close to a normal routine, the pain came back suddenly and the two outermost toes on my left leg were numb and my leg was very weak. The pain was almost too much to handle and I was home for about two weeks. My doctor suggested we try an epidural again since it’s worked in the past but here is my concern. The main sciatica pain in my glute and leg is mostly gone, 8/10 is now 3/10, but my leg is still unbelievable weak four days post epidural. Stepping in and out of the shower is scary, I have to sit or lean on something in order to lift my right leg because my left can’t support me and the best way I can describe my limp is that too much of my weight is being shifted to my left leg when I take a step.Does this mean the epidural didn’t work this time?

s," I'm going to try to be brief and kind of vague, but if I'm missing any vital information, please ask. There has been an offer made, and I'm  just looking for advice on if the amount I was offered is fair and I'm being greedy, or if I'm being taken advantage of.I work as a delivery driver for a snack food company. One morning I was parked at a convenience store, as I was standing in the back of my truck gathering up the order, an 18 wheeler from a beverage company was turning in and hit my truck. Although it was low impact, I ended up with severe back pain. Initially all of my medical bills were covered by my worker's compensation, with the understanding the beverage company would reimburse everything in the end. All total I had about 35 appointments with the doctor, physical therapy, and specialist, at the clinic over an hour away from my home and work (I did try to get treatment closer to home, but that was a whole different arguement with my company/worker's comp). About 8 months after the accident I reached maximum improvement, and was determined to have a single digit impairment rating. It's difficult to exactly calculate my lost wages since my hours vary every week, but I lost a minimum of $3000. My medical bills totaled ~$7500. The beverage company offered me a settlement of $5500. After adding lost wages, benefits for my impairment rating, the mileage for all of the appointments and pain and suffering (I used the formula of medical bills x3), I came up with a total of just over $35,000. I made a counter offer that left me some negotiation room. They said their best offer would be just under $9000.I've never dealt with anything like this, so I'm not sure how to proceed. I would like to get this settled and end the stress involved with it. But I will be dealing with back pain for the rest of my life and their offer doesn't seem fair, but maybe I'm over estimating my worth and the offer is fair.

s,"I am a 31 year old stay at home father of two young children and have been married for over 10 years. It feels lately like everything is coming to a head and I am drowning. I started having brain fog, joint pain, and other weird things in October that are possibly related to having Covid in June. To treat it my doctor decided to put me on an ssri, and upped my dose at the end of December. After the dose was upped i started acting progressively more and more crazy. It started getting bad when my wife and I let my best friend sleep in our bed with us after we had a couple friends over and their was nowhere else comfortable to sleep. After laying down I picked up on sexual tension between the two of them, got turned on and wound up having sex with my wife while he was in the bed and both of us kissed him (we were all very drunk). I asked my wife the next day what the fuck was going on and found out she had an affair with him for years stopping shortly before the conception of our first child. I knew about two instances of infidelity (making out) that i caught her doing while at parties, one with my prior best friend, one with a stranger. Throughout the next two weeks I slowly broke down, had dissociative episodes, one in which i scratched my wrist to bleeding without knowing, and one in which i punched holes in the wall and talked of suicide. The next day I went to the hospital and they determined i had serotonin syndrome due to the meds.This has triggered abandonment issues worrying that my wife was leaving me, which has been triggering flashbacks of childhood trauma. I keep having this one set of flashbacks when i was 12 where my dad beat me (he had a belt studded with his name in raised steel lettering he liked to use because it left his name in bruises), and I threatened to call the police/cps. He told me to do it and see how i liked foster care where i would be abused even worse. I told him someone else would take me in, that my grandma and grandpa that I was really close to would. He said no they wouldn't. Then the flashback jumps to the next day whenever I was alone with my grandma and told her what had happened, showed her the bruises, and asked her for hep, asked if they would take me in. She told me that my parents love me very much and are doing their best, and she will not come between us or get involved at all. That is where the flashback ends, and usually at this point I am shaking uncontrollably. The prevalence of this has caused me to think more of my childhood trauma and has gone on to trigger more flashbacks about my childhood, and flashbacks about finding out about the original infidelity. On top of that I am having nightmares about the two of them together that keep me from sleeping. This has cost me that best friend, my next closest friend has since gone to jail and is facing 2-10 years in prison, and i don't really have any other friends. My emotions are a mess and bouncing all over the place, and I need to talk through this shit with my wife regularly, which is making it hard for my wife to keep up with work and gradschool. I have been waiting to get into talk therapy for like 6 weeks now but still haven't gotten there yet. My back pain is now worse than it has been since i had surgery 9 years ago, our finances are shit...and yet somehow most days still feel like good days other than short episodes.

s,"Hey Reddit, hey TIFU friends.Actually this is my very first own post on reddit, so please bear with me as I'm not a native english speaker.It's a longer story, probably because I need to write out stuff, because of above mentioned reasons. As well as many other stories this actually didn't happen today or yesterday, but a little while back, about 5 years ago I'd say. At that time I still lived near my parents while doin my training at a local company. Often times at weekends I would visit my parents and help them with different stuff. Part of that was cutting wood and stuff because my parents bought a new modern wood oven for their home to save extra money. Because, you know, wood is actually free and gasoline and oil and stuff isn't. Well I think it was right before Easter and some good friends of my parents had a big ass tree in their garden they wanted to get rid of. So my parents as the penny pincher they are, were just the first ones to call for it.So at some friday or saturday mornin my dad and me were getting up at 7am to get ready to play some lumberjack. Unfortunatly my dad had a lumbago (big back pains) that morning and I had to drive him to the local hospital to get some painkillers (I think they even gave him an injection). But they told him not to do heavy work for a few days. As you can imagine cutting down a huge ass tree (okay wasn't thaaaat huge) IS some heavy work. At the largest point the tree was probably about 12m high and the trunk of the tree had about 1m in diameter. Well because I was young and healthy most of the work that day came back to me. I just put on some protective cloths and went to town with our chainsaw. It's not the biggest chaisaw (the saw blade is about 40cm), but it is handy and it does its job (You should know that the larger the saw blade gets, the bigger and the heavier gets the rest of the chainsaw as well). For the bigger branches and the trunk our chainsaw was too small so I drove to some retailer for garden equipment who also rented chainsaws. I got us a nice big 60cm saw blade chainsaw and went back to cut down the larger parts. After a few hours of cutting down shit most of the work was done and only about 1m of the trunk was left. My mum came over and we started to clean up the place and take home the wood with our car and trailer. When we were about to be finished my mom came up to me and asked me to cut the 1m trunk further down so that only like 20cm above the ground were left. That was about 6pm that day and after 9 hours of climbing and cutting this fuckin tree and running around to collect wood and driving shit home I was really tired and didn't want to go any further. But my mother insisted and begged me for like 10 minutes. Sorry for the longish prelude but now is where the actual fuckup begins.I already put down my protective gear (most important part of it are the trousers that are cut-resistant). Being the lazy bum I was at that time I didn't put on the trousers again and decided to do the last cut just with my jogging pants on. I was like: ""Yeah nothing happened the whole day and I just want to get it over with."" Well hell I was wrong. Because the trunk was so large in diameter I had to use the rented chainsaw again. I basicly squat down and began to slowly cut through it. After reaching about half of the trunk I started to cut from the other side to get rid of the rest. When I was nearly done the upper part of the trunk started to lean onto the saw blade, because it couldn't hold its own weight anymore. So it came to a point where I couldn't get the chainsaw out because the blade was stuck. I couldn't let go of the chainsaw as well and it started to become fuckin heavy to hold. My brother, who in the meantime arrived there too, began to pull the trunk into the opposite direction so I could get the saw blade out. I pulled some but it was still stuck. I slowly let the chain run and was pulling but still nothing happened. Then I decided on one final pull and speeding up the chain a bit more. That's when the blade became unstuck and I pulled it out, right to hit my left leg below the knee (not too hard). My jogging pants were instantly ripped where the sawblade hit my leg, but I didn't feel any pain and it also just felt like a slight clunk. My brother got instantly pale and asked me if everything is okay and I said: ""Yea I think I just ripped my pants, no pain dude."" He insisted on me to take a look below to confirm no damage was done. That's when I lifted my left trouserleg and saw what the fuck actually happened. I had a big open wound right below my knee. Flesh and skin shreds were hanging down from it, this shit was pretty disgusting. The wound was like 4-5 cm broad and 13-15cm long.. and fairly deep as I can remember. Well I was brought to the hospital and the doctor there stitched me together after putting 5-6 pain killer injections right into the wound. Hell that was probably the worst pain I ever felt in my life. Fortunatly the painkillers started to kick in like 1-2 Minutes later.In the end I couldn't walk for like 1-2 weeks without help and was sick at home for about four weeks. Fortunatly no serious damage was taken and I can walk normally again only with a scar rememberng me of that day.TLDR: Cut some wood, cut some more wood, after finished cutting wood was asked to make one last cut. Messed that shit up without protective gear and could count the rings in my leg instead the ones of the tree.",0.551292,0.591206,0.828278,0.0,0.52756,0.0,0.0,0.18233082706766918
c,"In the dying pangs of my relationship with my ex girlfriend her mom came to visit us from California. I'm not saying she was some super hot MILF a la Morgan Fairchild, but she was in her mid 40s at the time and I was 25, double DDs that looked natural from age, and thick hips, thighs, and butt. Face didn't age too bad either. Anyways, the overarching theme of my relationship with my ex was the complete lack of sex. I once resolved to stop initiating and we went 14 weeks before I broke down and had to initiate. By this point in time we're only putting on the smiling face of the relationship to appease our house guests, but I was living in the guest bedroom for the past 2 months. I was planning on moving out in the next week or so, but had to act like everything was okay while her family came into town for her graduation. Her mom took my bedroom so I was trying to pick up as many shifts as possible as not to have to sleep in the same bed with my soon to be ex. At some point in time I went to work my graveyard shift (why is it that all these situations with porn involve medics?) and came home exhausted from pulling back to back 16s and a 12 for good measure. Ex's mom was an ER RN at the time and worked graveyard so we were texting back and forth all night. In my utter exhaustion from running a code just before my shift ended and the combination of too little sleep and too much work I went downstairs to the bedroom I had been sleeping in instead of upstairs to the bedroom my soon to be ex and I had shared and were sharing because her family was in town. Her mom had only been asleep a few hours but had been talking about how her recent back injury from work was bothering her while we were texting. I woke her up while I was mid taking off my uniform and walking through the door. Kinda confused and still half awake she sat up, just in a tee shirt and panties and asked me how work was. I woke up and told her I was sorry, asked her how her back was feeling and if she had slept. She said she hadn't slept well. I know what came over me at that moment. It was the combination of being sex starved for the 4 years I'd been with her daughter. The fact that we had been broken up for two months, and I hadn't had an orgasm that wasn't of my own making for so long at that point I couldn't count. Added on top of that, working 44 out of the last 72 hours I hadn't had any opportunity to empty the chamber, so to speak. So I asked her if I could help her with her back pain. I'm sure she was still a little drugged out from the pain meds and muscle relaxers she was on. And I knew the last relationship she'd had had ended the year me and my ex started dating, which was 4 years prior to this point.  It started off, for me, trying to be as innocent of a back rub as possible, getting to the spot in her lower back that really hurt and pushing my thumbs into it in circles. Little by little she urged me to go down towards her hips and thighs. Being turned on at this point I put my hands down at her hips then moved to the outer part of her thighs. When I got braver I put both of my hands around the lower part of her thigh and started to knead my way upwards to her pubic arch. The little breaths she was making the entire time turned into moans at this point and I'm sure you can write the ending for this one. TL;DR: A week before I moved out of the townhouse I'd shared with my ice queen girlfriend for the past 4 years I banged her mom.",0.0,0.687912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19258202567760344

s,"This may not be the exact fit for this subreddit but this has always been a supportive group for me even if I have never posted here before.Yesterday my wife started feeling pains in her lower back. Towards late evening her back pain got so bad and her muscle spasms got so bad that I had to call an ambulance to come take her to the ER because I couldn't get her to the car. We got to the hospital right around midnight. The ER looked at her back a little and were going to do a pregnancy test to make sure it is OK to give her pain killers, but they couldn't get her to urinate for the test so they just gave her pain meds. After awhile the pain meds and muscle relaxants weren't doing a good enough job so they got her a room and admitted her into the hospital. This was around 6:30 am or so. After she got situated in I left and got home around 7. I don't really remember going home that well, but I woke up in my bed fully clothed, shoes and everything and apparently I left an obscure message on my mom's voice mail.Today she is doing better with the new pain killers they have her on. The doctors and nurses in the general hospital are better than the ones in ER. one of them even went down to ER to scold them because they did a lot of mistakes apparently. They drew blood for a pregnancy test and got her rehydrated. I am not a father yet, which is good news since we are not ready for children yet. They did a CT scan to see what is up, but the doctor left before she got the scan done so tomorrow we find out the results. I woke up around 1pm and spent the day there.

I use it for pain relief though so I am usually always trying to take enough to relieve pain which is usually close to the ceiling effects for kratom. I decided to finally try it mainly because I am trying to find something sustainable and somewhat cost effective for excruciating chronic back pain, I've been running a home business for years now and it is not physically demanding but unfortunately I haven't been bringing in enough profit so I am trying to get prepared to start working a job again.

s,"I can’t say I know where it started, but I feel like I always knew something was wrong with me. I’m 27 and since I’m getting older, I started to say things to myself like, “Lots of people have chronic lower back pain,” and “I just need to start eating better.” But really, my hair is falling out, some days I‘m so exhausted, I spend the entirety in bed and these things are not normal. For anyone. I went to see a dermatologist who addressed some surface skin issues, while my internal ones continued to rage. A blood test showed my vitamin D at 14 and my DHEA - s at 500. This sort of explained to me why I could feel like a race car, but still feel exhausted. I wanted to jump out of my skin and the vitamin D deficiency was putting me in a sickly dissociative, dream state, which I now know is common with low vitamin D.  So, I spend six months getting my D to normal, but I still have high DHEA-s and my hair is still falling out. My dermatologist’s suggestion? A tumor. Oh god, I have a tumor. I go get an MRI.I go back to my primary care provider to get a referral to an endocrinologist. It isn’t my regular doctor and this guy googles PCOS in front of me, as I tell him why I’m pretty sure I have it, because I need the referral. He scans the page — a page I looked at myself, in the early stages of my WebMD panic and asserts that I cannot have PCOS, on the basis that I am neither fat or unattractive. I tell him that I need to speak with someone more knowledgeable and he gives me my referral.I take my MRI to an endocrinologist, thinking this is the moment that I will finally get my answers. At this point, I’m ready for my tumor. Give it me. If it’s a tumor, then I can just cut this problem out and I will be ok.

She ends with a slightly more professional  “ hOrMoNes ArE WeIRd ???” I leave her office with no wind left in my sails.A few weeks later I get motivated again and scheduled an appointment at my local planned parenthood.

I thought it sucked to have both at the same time because the cramping and back pain are awful alone but with the added burn from the UTI I just wanted to not be me for a few days.Come this morning, I was crazy tired, thought it was a reaction to the antibiotics or the infection, whatever.

c,"An exercise like the deadlift is designed to train you how to engage your entire posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes, hips, low-back). Substituting that with something like a TotalGym squat is not the same thing. Machines limit your range of motion, and this limits your ability to recruit sets of muscles in a functional manner. It also limits your flexibility and ""fitness = strength + flexibility"". You can do deadlifts and squats at home with ordinary household items. Grab one end of the couch and do deadlifts with that. Fill a backpack with books or jugs of water and do squats with that. Caveat: doing such exercises also requires learning how to lift with proper form, otherwise you can get permanent back injuries, etc. and screw up your ability to workout for life. To this end, spending the money on a trainer who can correct your form is a better investment than a Total Gym (although you can learn good form from resources on the internet, but it really helps if you have some to watch you, or at least use a mirror or a video camera). Part of the discipline of weight training is learning how to use your body to handle weight in the safest way, which will no longer put you at risk for injury but prevent you from injury and chronic problems like low back pain. Having bashed on machines, the Total Gym does use cables and has a moving plank, so it looks like it'd be a good tool for an upper body workout. It's probably also a good tool for full-body cardio workout without putting undue strain on the knees and legs if you're body weight is still too high to safely allow for running.

Yesterday my husband and I went for a walk at the mall and when we got back I was having tummy tightening every 15 min. This went down to every 10 min and would be more erratic so we gave up trying to count. We went to bed and had a little fun. About a half hour later I was rolling around uncomfortable and went to bathroom. I had a weird pressure on my tailbone (almost as if you have to poop). Few min later I was getting back pain that was really uncomfortable. My husband called the doctor again (first time they said it was just braxton) and with info this time he wanted to see me. By the time we got to hospital the contractions were 2 min apart and hooked to the monitors showed they were starting to become regular at 1-2 min. The doctor looked at my cervix and said it was 3cm and it REALLLLY hurt (I am guessing he swept the membranes bc I was bleeding pretty bad and later he said he did something). Anyway, after 2 hrs of being 3cm and 75% effaced the strong contractions faded? I mean pretty much gone... My cervix never went further, and things went back to normal... The doctor said he could not keep me so sent my husband and I home (My husband was NOT happy with doc for that as he did not want to use one of his days if I was not in labor. He went to work today with 15 min of sleep)So my question to you is has anyone had or having something similar happen to them and what now? a 3cm I read people can be that for weeks but my combo is I am 3cm, had labor, 75% effaced, baby's head was pushing hard, and I think membranes stripped?

s,"  Experts agree that meditation is a powerful practice. Complete scientific studies have shown that the deep relaxation that comes with meditation has a various number of benefits on our physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing.***Increased Immunity:***Researchers at Harvard Medical School discovered that meditation has the power and ability to change the body on a genetic level. Long-term practice of yoga and meditation were shown to have far more disease-fighting genes. The study showed that within two months of developing a meditation practice, the genes that help to kill diseased cells, fight inflammation, and protect the body from cancer all began to activate within the body.***Pain Management:***Pain and stress are closely related. Meditation has the aptitude to increase pain tolerance while also decreasing depression, anxiety. Mindfulness meditation has been used successfully as a pain management method for people who suffer from various conditions, including headaches, chest pain, lower back pain, and intestinal discomfort.***Improved Sleep:***Sleeping disorders affect millions of people around the world, and for many, these sleep disorders are due to stress. A study revealed that meditation could help to remove those restless nights. The daily practice of meditation reduces the levels of insomnia, depression, and fatigue by the end of the six sessions.***Increased Fertility:***When a female’s body is in continuous stress, blood flow is directed towards the muscles, and away from the uterus and ovaries, that meaning the reproductive system does not function at its optimal level. Studies have proven that women are far more likely to conceive when they are in a relaxed state. So, doctors and fertility experts are advising women to introduce meditation as a means to assist conception.***Lowers Blood Pressure:***Meditation can lower blood pressure by making the body less responsive to stress hormones.***Improved Digestion:***The digestive system is one of the biological processes most affected when the body is in stress and anxiety. Stress can cause havoc on the gut, causing acid reflux, inflammation, ulcers, and even food allergies. By relaxing the mind and body, meditation allows for a deep level of relaxation that significantly improves the digestive system’s proficiency.***Emotional Wellbeing:***Meditation has been shown to help with self-confidence, self-acceptance, personal growth, and an increased sense of determination.

In June I began to have a pain in my right calf and over time, noticed my right leg would go completely numb from the top of the thigh down. As time has gone on I believe it must be sciatica triggered by how I have been sitting at work. I now do yoga, the elliptical, and low back stretches. Though I wouldn’t say I have any back pain. It’s all primarily in my leg/s. Mostly my right leg and mostly in the calf. None of my exercise has improved It but I only started diligently exercising a month ago. My arms also go numb when I lay in my bed, and I can only guess I also have a pinched nerve between my shoulders. If I wiggle my arm around or press it, the numbness will fade and return and fade and return until finally it fades completely. This doesn’t happen every night. Now for my headaches, this has been more long term than anything else. When I eat certain fast food I get these horrible pressure headaches that feel like swelling. And when I strain to have a bm or even pass gas (and I wouldn’t even call it straining tbh) this swelling like pressure envelopes my head and it feels like if I kept going I would just die.

In contrast, **the United States ranks high overall for age-standardized YLD rates compared with OECD countries, although age-standardized YLD rates are measured with wider uncertainty intervals than age-standardized YLL rates.** Relative to other OECD nations, the United States has below-average age-standardized DALY rates for low back pain, stroke, falls, and colorectal cancer. **It has higher than OECD mean rates for a number of leading diseases and injuries, such as COPD, road injury, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and interpersonal violence.** &gt; **In 2010, the United States had age-standardized rates above the mean for OECD countries for 16 of the top 30 diseases and injuries contributing to YLLs**. At the same time, the US rates were below the mean in men for stroke, colorectal cancer, and falls and in women for stroke. The United States also had lower mean rates in 1990 for a longer list of diseases and injuries contributing to YLLs including stroke, self-harm, lower respiratory tract infections, colorectal cancer, congenital anomalies, cirrhosis, and stomach cancer.

I swore I would come back directly after the funeral, so they left my IV in place and taped it up so I could go home and shower before the funeral.

Not super dramatic or anything.Cast: Me= meM= my mom EK = entitled kidEM= Entitled momThis happened years ago when I was a kid. I think around 10. My mom and I were on the way to my soccer game. We were less then 2 minutes from home, on a street where only the side streets had stop signs. So we had the right away, and the EM should have stopped at the stop sign. All of a sudden, a car BLOWS through the intersection and we end up T-boning EM’s car, my mom’s car being absolutely totalled. We all get out and my mom is checking me to see if I am okay before asking the EM what the heck she was thinking, running through a stop sign, especially at such a high speed and in a residential area.The EM starts off by saying she did nothing wrong before muttering a bunch of sorry’s. At this point, a person on my soccer team was passing and their parents ended up taking me to the game where I didn’t play, obviously cause I was so shaken up. I went through years of blinding migraines and back pain to the point where one migraine was so bad that I ended up hospitalized and they put pain killers in me through IV drip. I ended up having to take court mandated kinesiology sessions cause the back and neck/migraine pains were so bad. In the end, my parents obviously sued. We ended up settling and I have some money hidden away for when I start a family and want to put a down payment on a house. The kicker and the reason the EM is especially entitled? She ran the stop sign cause her son had woken up late and was late for an exam. He obviously ended up missing the exam anyways.Edit: idk why I made a cast when I didn’t really use it lol",0.0,0.591454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2792022792022792

c,"I feel very strongly about this, I know this is Reddit and not a therapist but I feel like I need to get this off my chest. I'm quite obese, I'm not a blob, I hold my weight well, and I am working on it, but it's not easy for me. My dad's mother was very strict about them finishing all their food, but it's because they didn't often have enough money to actually eat. More than once my dad was sent to the shop to steal a tin of beans because they couldn't afford to buy one, and it's all they'd have too. This is in the UK, back when a tin of beans cost about 5p, 7p for Heinz beans. They couldn't afford cereal either, so they would eat bread submerged in milk, because bread was cheaper. My dad loved it, and never realised that it was because they were poor until he was in his 20s. Fast forward a few years, my mum and dad are married, and dad was extremely adamant about me finishing everything on my plate. I used to have a small appetite, not being able to finish even a Macdonalds happy meal, but when I was full, dad would get angry and start to shout at me for being wasteful, my mum would try to prevent this but it never worked. I have a distinct memory of being late to something when I was little, we were visiting someone I think, and my mum had gone on ahead, she had brought me home a happy meal because it was faster than cooking. (This is making it sound like all I ate was Macdonalds, this was not the case, my mum home cooked for us every meal every day that she was able, MacDonalds were for when we went out of town to visit my aunts and grandparents). My dad didn't like how slowly I was eating, and held me down to force feed me fries and chicken nuggets, multiple at a time so it would go faster. The result of all of this is that now, even if I'm full, I have to finish everything, and if other people leave anything, I need to finish that too. The weird thing is that I KNOW that I don't have to. But part of me tells me that I do, because deep inside I know that leaving any food waste is wrong, even though it isn't.  And I'm still obese. I eat all the right foods, my favourite dinner is lean pork, potatoes and roasted tomatoes. but because when anyone leaves anything, I feel obligated to eat it. my appetite is smaller than what I make because I'm used to making more food than I want to eat because I was often yelled at for not cooking for my sister too when I was first learning, but when she doesn't want any, I need to eat it all. My weight makes life difficult. I feel self-conscious every day, I have issues with my leg muscles which are unrelated to my weight, but compounded with it gives me chronic back pain if I move more than a few meters. and my mum and dad often make comments about it, not realising it's their fault I'm like this. I'm now type 1 diabetic and have severe mental health issues. I can't get a job because nobody wants to hire fatties like me. I know this was long, but this post is so important. Don't eat if you don't want to, it can ruin lives. TL;DR: Being forced to finish everything on my plate fucked me up, maybe for life.

c,"Many would say that Flexeril is the first, best pharmaceutical option, and you may want to give it a few days to work.

Amitriptyline and Flexeril are related chemically, but  with amitriptyline we have 50 years of experience with much higher dosages.  By the time you get to 50mg of Amitriptyline in the evening, almost everybody would have very noticeable relief from both migraines and muscle tension headaches (and many of the stress-related digestive issues, sleep disturbances, low back pain etc. that so frequently accompany ""TMJ syndrome"".

s,"On each side of my lower back, about 2 inches out from the center of my spine, around the sacroiliac crest I have two ""protrusions"" that feel like fat, or something.  A few times I have leaned back and put pressure on them, and they seemed to ""pop"" back in for a while, but then popped back out again.  They no longer pop back in, just always out now.  They don't really hurt, but my lower back goes out anytime I lift something even if I do it properly, like I have my Fiance tie my shoes now because I gave up.Stretching makes it worse, working out makes it worse, sitting makes it worse, standing PERFECTLY straight up seems to be the best thing for me.  Walking, Running, Swimming, all seem to aggravate it no matter how slow or gently I go.Let's see... Along my spine from those two nodules down, at about .5"" from the center of spine I can feel these muscles that feel very bumpy and there are like little smaller nodules, but if I press on them they hurt in a very strange like burning sensation that my brain screams ""STOP!"" when I do it.  There are probably 4-6 of them that tend to be at varying levels of swollen-ness.I found the other day a spot in my left and right butt cheek that hurts REALLY bad, I had a massage stick and pressed it into the tissue and it hurt so bad I almost fell over.  I had tingling in my shoulders, and definitely assuming a nerve is involved.I've been to 3 specialists, each said I have stenosis and when I showed them the large nodules that are on my sacro crests, they all 3 kinda went ""hmm..."" and said not to worry about them.The thing is, whenever my back does go out, those things turn into little swollen round nodes, about 3x bigger than usual and they seem to like, inflate to where they actually feel like round balls the size of a large marble or a ping pong ball.When I was younger I had an accident on a trampoline where I scorpioned really hard and couldn't breathe for about a minute, then had back pain since.My lovely parents refused to believe me and told me to ""suck it up"" and now I'm mid 30's and about to lose my job because I can't seem to get it to stop going out.When it goes out, it's shooting pain, I am stuck on the couch one leg up, if I try to sit up, bend, etc it's excruciating and if I try to fight through it I just can't, it's as if the nerves wont send the signals to get the muscles to flex rightSometimes I can feel that it's about to go out, and if I stand up real straight and do some ""put hands on those bumps, push hips forward, lean back hold"" stretches it sort of helps, but usually I just have to go to sleep and hope it's better the next day.I've been to 2 physical therapists, but apparently they don't want to deal with me.  They won't let me use their equipment, so I just get an ice pack and the Tens on me then sends me home.  I asked both why and they said there's been a rash of lower back pain patients in recent years suing them when they get hurt so they just don't even deal with it now, they give you printouts and tell you to do it at home so they aren't responsible.I also have many spots on my bodies with muscles that I have to routinely massage to the point that I'm about to cry, including those ones in my butt cheeks, my shoulders, my neck, etc.  Basically for every part of my body there's at least 1-2 muscles that I have to work out weekly at least or they just keep tightening and tightening.I noticed recently that when I cough, I feel this like ""bursting"" sensation, but it's not like painful, more just like ""Aaawww, what was that?"" and a bit of a tingle, but it usually is in the right side of the pube area of the groin, and sometimes when I cough it feels like something in the lumbar regions is flexing and ""bursting"" as well.I saw a specialist last week to see if I have a hernia maybe, they said no.They also looked at the two nodes on my sacro crest and said ""huh.. dunno"" even though I brought some printouts of this specific hernia that can occur there and he basically was like ""never heard of it, probably bullshit."" and didn't really seem to really care about looking into it further in spite of a few studies I printed out and brought him.eh... let's see, that's about all I can think of, I'm not looking for a diagnosis or anything, just ideas in case I missed something.  Maybe something I haven't heard of or even noticed yet.Thanks all, be amazing if someone had info I could use to better this because it's taking me down almost 1x a week at this point in so much pain I just kinda roll around on the couch moaning, I'm sure it's not as bad as some other people's, but I'd like to find a way to minimize it if possible.Oh one doc also said I have ""Schmorles"" nodes, and he was an Indian doc that told me he usually only see's those in patients over the age of 60, and in people my age he said he usually only see's the damage in child laborers that carry massive loads at a young age.Well lo and behold, my stepdad was basically a psychotic slave driver that had me rolling 200lb rounds of lodgepole into trucks when I was 7-18 nearly every weekend and I basically did spend my childhood laboring for him and thinking back I did remember a few times lifting heavy rounds and then laying under the truck for a while because it hurt, but it was NOTHING like now, it's like 10x more painful now.THanks!",0.0,0.740523,0.911659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18439024390243902

c,"&gt; Every drug on the market has lots of reproducibility behind it. A doctor would be crazy to make hard and fast predictions about the results of any treatment. For the vast majority of pharmaceuticals, the simple question ""will this drug work for me"" is difficult to answer with confidence. Will aspirin prevent a heart attack? Well, statistically, yes, they'll reduce the incidence and severity of heart attacks, but boiled down to the individual basis the confidence is mostly gone. So when someone asks his doctor ""Hey doc, if I take aspirin, will I have a heart attack in the next decade,"" the doctor will answer ""it depends.""  And then there are non-drug treatments. Is surgery effective for dealing with back pain? Is a low fat diet effective for reducing the incidence of stroke? Also, drug testing is such a small part of what medicine is about. There are many medical claims that are not testable/reproducible, because reproducing the effects would be unethical. How much ionizing radiation can the human body take, anyway? How long does it take for untreated HIV to turn into full-blown AIDS? Exactly how dangerous is asbestos? What happens if this part of the brain gets damaged? These questions are medical science, are they not? But any theory can't be directly tested in a controlled experiment. We can only hope that statistical tools (probably first developed by economists) give strong inductive hints towards a tentative conclusion. This method of arriving at theory is pretty much how macroeconomics has to work.  Meanwhile, behavioral economics is tested in laboratories, and game theory is essentially another branch of mathematics. The obvious economics claims are obvious now, but they really weren't 100 years ago. I know what happens to the price of Coca Cola when there's a Pepsi shortage. I know what happens to oil prices when civil wars break out in the Middle East. I know that rent control leads to housing shortages, and that low interest rates lead to greater borrowing and less saving, and that a 100% tax rate leads to near-zero productivity. This isn't where the controversies lie, so we never talk about them. I'm also not going to get started on the testability of theories regarding the very large or the very small things in physics. Science isn't defined by testability or predictive ability. We might know a thing or two about protein folding, but we don't have models that look at a string of nucleotides and say what a gene does. We rely instead on doing research on certain genetic markers and doing good old fashioned statistics-compilation to determine what a certain gene is for.

c,"sciatica pain isn't back pain. Its nerve impingement. Thats fixed with sacral realignment and stretching Psoas. Now, I'm not the biggest fan of chiropractors because most of them dont care about doing their job correctly (supporting the sacrum to prevent causing damage and pain). Getting a crack isn't the goal. Subluxations are the problem. The vertebra are already subluxated. to fix the problem you subluxate further to the original proper position. Its pretty cut and dry that if bones are pressing on nerve fibers that relieving the pressure from the nerve will relieve the issue. Doing that for every single episode of back pain regardless of the cause is what your sources are referring to. Thats not the scope of a chiropractor thats the scope of a con artist trying to sell you something you don't need (an adjustment on an area that you didn't have a problem with.)  TL;DR the use of adjustments should be relegated to specific disorders. There's science backing up the cause and effect relationship of adjustments specific to appropriate disorders. There's nothing solid backing up its use for generalized pain. Its like going to a dentist because your jaw hurts...

I’ve been suffering with a fairly bad kidney infection for 2 weeks now, I’m currently on my third course of different antibiotics which I was put on by a doctor the Friday just gone (3 days ago) along with some anti-sickness meds as I’ve not been able to keep any food down. He also sent my urine sample to the lab as it was testing positive for white blood cells so he wanted to ensure the bacteria was sensitive to the antibiotics he’d chosen. He followed up with the advice of if anything gets worse over the weekend or if I’m the same by Monday (today) then I need to be seen again, worst case, in the emergency department. Today comes around and I’d say I feel pretty worse, my breathing is quite laboured, I had a pretty bad dizzy spell yesterday which lead to me falling down a few steps, my back pain is awful and my urine output is considerably lower but just as painful and I feel super emotional and tetchy. I got a phone call from the receptionist at my docs to confirm the bacteria was sensitive to the tablets I’m on so they don’t need changing but that if I felt the same I’d need to be seen again. Since then it’s all gone to shit, the doctor I spoke to just said to continue taking the antibiotics until Friday, the out of hours said I could be seen but I’d be sent home as they trust the advice of my gp, the clinician I’ve spoken to was concerned about urinary sepsis so I went down to ED and they said it’d be a waste of time me waiting as they’re so busy and I’d be better off going home and calling my doc again tomorrow. I just don’t know what to do, I feel so awful and from the little research I’ve done, this isn’t normal either but nobody seems to be concerned so do I just have to ride it out or is it worth me pushing to be seen tomorrow??",0.0,0.649858,0.897575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2602739726027397

Can I sue my Auto Insurance Company?  In 2005, as part of our divorce agreement, my ex and I decided to keep the same auto insurance but under separate policies. We had been with this company for years. My policy was on auto pay meaning that the payments were taken directly from my account. He walked in to pay his.     About 6 months after the divorce, I was pulled over for a routine traffic stop and was told I was driving an uninsured vehicle. Without insurance, my registration was also invalid. Both tickets totaled 1K. My car was taken into impound. I checked and found the officer was correct. On good terms with my ex, I told him what happened. He said for the past 6 months, each time he went in to make a payment, the girl HIS was already paid.     Realizing what had happened. They were applying my payments to his automobile. I was furious. I notified the agent who initially did not want to accept blame, but since the payments were automatic and my account number was on each payment they took, they were responsible. The error was compounded by the fact that the cancellation notice went to HIS address (how dumb was that!) So I had no way of knowing that I was cancelled. I was without a car for 2 weeks and lost my job. After much haggling and many sleepless nights of wondering what to do without a job or a car, the insurance company finally admitted blame, paid the impound fees of $1,250.00. The agent also said they would handle the 2 tickets totaling 1K.     FAST FORWARD TO 2010   in my state, the county did a scofflaw sweep and I was summoned to court with over 5 thousand other delinquent drivers to address unpaid tickets. The order was come to court by April 30th or be arrested. Realizing this had to be a mistake, but fearful of the law, I stood in line for over 5 hours in blazing heat, then sat in court another 5 hours waiting for my day in court.     I was immediately threatened with arrest because the 2 tickets were not paid. Up to that moment, I had no idea the insurance company had not paid the 2 tickets. This time, not only was my insurance and registration cancelled, my license was suspended due to the age of the infraction (5 years). In front of the judge, I called the agents' office only to be told by the secretary that they had no intention to pay the ticket. Paying to get the car out of impound was enough. When the judge heard this she was shocked and let me off with a promise to pay in 5 days. She made me promise not to drive. With no way to get home but drive, I took a chance, and was pulled over. The officer informed me that due to the vast number of outstanding cases, tags bearing our county name would be targeted for a while (talk about a police state!). I showed him my documents from the court and headed home.     This is a nightmare. Would I have a case if I filed suit against my insurance company for failing in their fiduciary responsibility to a 16 year client in good standing? By the way this company is one of the largest in the country.""  How can I save on car insurance? I live in SC, and is 21 years old.

s,"I really try to be in bed when I call it ""day number whatever"" but, I'll call it from my couch. Ok! Here we are day 10! Still sluggish mixed with lower back pain. Also upper legs and knees are sore as all heck. That maybe the onset of my 40's with PAWS though. I just roll with it. OK, I'm feeling the depression starting to lift just a touch. Nothing too spectacular but worth every bit in my opinion. I observed how easily I'm to get frustrated or even angry with people over the smallest details; I'll take that as a sign of actually feeling the healing. Like I said yesterday, we gotta start at the bottom of the emotional barrel to make it back out. So! Anger it is for today and hopefully tomorrow will show a glimmer of excitement, joy, happiness, or something positive dammit! Let me stop complaining for a second and share something good. I took my lunch with my bestie today. We went to a local record shop to check out the leftover spoils from Record Store Day. We found a few gems but, what really hit home was the music. We picked out an old Dinosaur Jr record and put it on the listening station player. We plugged in the headphones and sat on the floor. Man! The honorable Robert Nesta Marley was right! When the music hits you, you feel alright. Too hear those distorted chords fall from J's guitar just melted me. I'm a music buff. I live for it. I bleed music. I'll buy an album just to listen to somebody in the background playing a tambourine. Kratom zapped that love from me. And today my bestie held my hand while I pushed my head into her shoulder and cried to every note. I wasn't crying because I was sad. I was crying because I could feel that sensation of joy music brings us. It's what bonds her and I together. I don't know if she planned this or what. What I can say it felt like the biggest bandaid placed over a very deep open wound that I allowed kratom to cut into me and everyone I love. To you, the person in day 1, 2, 3, or 4 right now. Hang tough with me and all of us. We are here for you. Those who are on day 11-30 have been here for me. We make each other stronger by staying on here and talking about this. We are all valuable threads woven together in this blanket of healing. Keep talking. Keep checking in. And stay the course. Don't ever give up.

c,"Hi, I need to address some of the things that you have said. There are a lot of people in this sub who give out information on topics that they do not have the requisite knowledge of. &gt;Usually radiating pain is due to some sort of pinching or pressure directly on a nerve from inflammation   Direct, mechanical impinging of a nerve will only cause pain if the nerve itself is inflamed. Otherwise it causes a momentary discharge of the nerve, but does not activate specific pain fibres of the nerve. Further to this, pain from an impinged nerve (radicular pain) would not be described by the sufferer as radiating - they would more often that not describe it as having the qualities of an electrical shock, to very specific areas, not vague, as OP's pain sounds. His/her pain sounds more like somatic referred pain.   See **Bogduk, N. (2009). On the definitions and physiology of back pain, referred pain and radicular pain. *Pain, 147*, 17 – 19** for a more detailed explanation. &gt;I do not believe that over-rotation of the hips could cause radiating pain in the neck and jawline   It may not be directly responsible, but there could be an indirect link. Eg. Poor hip and lumbo-pelvic stability can cause other muscles to attempt to aid in stabilisation. The contralateral gluteals overwork, attempting to stabilise, leading to the ipsilateral lats and lower traps then activating as part of the posterior oblique sling. This then pulls the ipsilateral scapula into depression and downward rotation, forcing the upper trap to be overactive to attempt to prevent it. Progressive overload of the upper trap leads to formation of a latent myofascial trigger point, which refers pain into the neck and jaw area when the muscle is loaded. So please, stop spreading misinformation. Why on earth people ask these sort of questions on here is beyond me. No one can properly answer the question without physically assessing you, so just go to a bloody Physio (and yes, I am one)",0.0,0.680758,0.884418,0.696418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2261904761904762
c,"In general if your goal is good ergonomics and not wrecking your back, you're best off looking at office chairs and ergonomic chairs as opposed to gaming chairs. Remember that a good portion of the price tag for any gaming chair is the branding, and as such you can almost always find something equivalent or better for a similar price by looking in the office chair market.  It's also worth keeping in mind adjustability. Gaming chairs are NOT one size fits all, if you do go down the gaming chair route, you need to find a specific model that fits YOUR size and shape. The Secretlab Titan is designed with larger people in mind, and doesn't have backrest height adjustment, lumbar height adjustment, or seat pan depth adjustment. That means if you're too short for the chair, the lumbar support won't be in the right place, causing back pain, and you'll get cut off circulation in your legs with long sitting periods from the seat pan. The seat pan depth on the Titan for example is 52.5cm. That's very deep. 47-48cm is enough to cut off circulation very badly for me, I need around 42-44cm ideally, so I absolutely couldn't use the chair. I'm on the shorter size (5'7) but my legs are on the longer side for my height (I have a short torso instead) so I suspect unless you're pretty tall you're going to have problems. If you are tall, it might be a good fit, but even an inch can make a big difference so I wouldn't buy one without first trying it out. Lumbar support being too high is even worse because it'll actually cause worse back pain than a chair with just a flat back. Getting the lumbar support in the right place is crucial, and where that is will depend on the length of your torso, which is again height dependent. So if you have a shorter torso or aren't quite tall, you might again have trouble with the Titan, since it's only depth adjustable, not height adjustable, and if it's placed too high it'll worsen your back pain. If you want to avoid pain from sitting your chair basically needs to meet one of the two following criteria: - Lumbar support height, seat pan depth, and arm-rest height should all be adjustable within a good range. - OR, the ones that aren't adjustable should all happen to be exactly the right height/size/etc for your particular body shape. You can only find out if a chair is a perfect fit without adjustments by sitting in it for at least several hours, and ideally a few days. I could sit in something with a huge seat pan in the shop and find it comfortable - it's only after sitting on it for say 40-60 minutes when my legs would be completely numb and I'd have to stand up. My suggestion would be to go to an office supply store that sells various ergonomic chairs, and try a few out. See if you can get the lumbar support to sit in the small of your back, your forearms to rest on the arm rests at about a 90* angle from your upper arms, and that you can get the seat pan to where you can fit a few fingers between the front edge of the seat, and the back of your calves. Assuming you can do that, the chair should be a good ergonomic fit, and now it's just a matter of whether or not you find the materials it's made of comfortable for long sitting. At this point it might be worth asking the store if you can take it home for a week to try out. They'll often let you do that (you may have to provide collateral). **TL;DR though, the Titan doesn't have the necessary adjustments to make it a one size fits all chair. It'll fit some tall folks perfectly, some tall folks okay, and most other people poorly. If you're not one of the people it fits perfectly, it'll be just as bad for your back as your cheap Amazon chair. The most important aspect to preventing pain with your chair is ensuring the chair fits you, NOT what materials the chair is made of or how much it costs. A cheap but well fitting chair will always beat even a $2000+ chair that's a bad fit.** As for Herman Miller, it depends on the chair. I'm sitting on an Aeron right now, and if you're in the US you can grab one used in amazing condition for a similar price to the Titan. It meets two of the three adjustment requirements I mentioned, but doesn't have adjustable seat pan depth. So if you want to buy an Aeron you'll either need to find out using chairs you have access to what size seat pan you need, and then buy the corresponding model of Aeron (there are 3 sizes, A, B, and C, with different dimensions) - or you'd have to find ones to sit in and see for yourself. For me the size B is a perfect fit. If you did go the Herman Miller route, and don't have the opportunity to test before buying, you might be better off with something like the Mirra 2. It's actually typically cheaper than the Aeron, but it addresses some of the complaints people had about the Aeron, like the lack of seat pan depth adjustment. So you don't have to worry about buying the right size, you should be able to adjust it to fit you.  Don't just look at Herman Miller though. I like my Aeron, but you don't need to go as pricey as an Aeron to get a good ergonomic chair. Just keep those 3 adjustments I mentioned earlier in mind: Lumbar height (or backrest height, since that basically achieves the same thing), seat pan depth, and arm-rest height.  A great budget option would be the Staples Tarance if you're in the US. It's around $200 and has adjustable arm rests, adjustable lumbar support, adjustable seat pan depth. It's also mesh and apparently a very comfortable budget alternative to the Aeron. Plus, unlike the Aeron it even comes with a headrest, so great if you like reclining and don't want to shell out another $100-200 for one of the aftermarket Aeron headrests. I've heard it's sturdy and holds up well too. That would certainly be my budget pick in the US. If you're in the EU it's a little trickier, you might want to look specifically at brands local to your country as they often have some of the better budget options. For example here in Poland there are some amazing chairs by a company called Profim, that fit all those criteria, and are much cheaper than Herman Miller etc.  ",0.555414,0.511627,0.704143,0.562779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1586327782646801
s,"Hi all - happy to have found this community and wanted to take some time to introduce myself and share my story. A few Saturdays ago, I woke up with significant pain and cramping in my left leg. When I got up and started walking around, I noticed it was swollen and discolored. I was considering just trying to walk it off, but the swelling and the color made me think twice. I spent the day in the ER (at the hospital I happen to work at - I am a hospital administrator) and was ultimately sent home with the only significant finding being “slow blood flow” in my left leg. I had instructions to rest as well as to get a follow-up ultrasound in a week at my primary care doctor’s office. The next day my pain wasn’t any better, so I reached out to a vascular surgeon I happen to work with regularly in my job. I asked her if she wouldn’t mind taking a look at my chart and seeing if she agreed with the findings. She called me later that evening and asked me to come in for a repeat ultrasound first thing in the morning. The next morning, she did a duplex scan and found a blood clot that was essentially spanning my entire leg, thigh to ankle. I was immediately admitted to the hospital and given a chest CT scan where two bilateral pulmonary emboli were found as well as the source of the clot in my iliac vein. I was started on a heparin drip and scheduled for a thrombolysis procedure the next day. During the procedure, it was discovered that I have May Thurner Syndrome. I had to immediately discontinue my oral contraceptives and I am having a full hematology workup, but there’s a large chance I won’t have to deal with something like this again. I have a permanent iliac vein stent and a temporary filter in my inferior vena cava that will come out in a few months. I’ve now been home from the hospital for two weeks. I have two more weeks of Lovenox self-injections before I switch to Xarelto. I really don’t have any leg pain at all anymore, although I am experiencing a fair bit of lower back pain. My bruising fades every day, and I’m returning to work this week. I am thankful for my health, for a community of people who have been through the same, for fantastic doctors and nurses, that I didn’t clot while on a 15 hour flight or in a foreign country, that I was close to home, and honestly that there’s nothing for me to have to cancel or miss out on while I am recovering.

s," I don't typically share personal things publicly, but I really want to celebrate what has been going on in my life this year so far. God has lead me down a road of many changes and it has been quite the adventure (as it always is when you follow God, the dreamer of big dreams.) In late 2018 I developed issues with my intestines which led to a severe elimination diet to try and narrow down the cause. A side effect of this elimination diet was that for the first time I lost significant weight. I had always thought it was hopeless and had simply accepted that I would be morbidly obese, I was 272 lbs. (My family had told me both that I needed to lose weight warning me I will get bigger and bigger, while also dissuading me from trying to lose weight because everyone in our family fails and ends up depressed and larger than when they started.) Even after the elimination diet was ended by my doctor I continued to try to diet and exercise at home. I lost 45 lbs over the course of 2019 and then plateaued. In December 2019 my mom was diagnosed with a heart condition that was 90% due to her diet and lack of exercise and 10% genetic. Well I have her genes and lifestyle so it scared me a lot. I was scared I'd lose my mom soon and that i'd end up dying young. So, in January 2020 I decided to get help and I signed up at a gym with a trainer. I had always avoided it since I was scared I would get a drill sergeant type trainer, but God led me to a kind, gentle, and patient trainer. With the help of my doctor, trainer, and a fantastic group of supportive family, friends, and co-workers that God has blessed me with I have been able to lose 100 lbs! I have not had back pain related to a near fatal 2013 car accident since February! I feel far more confident, energized, empowered, and I'm having a lot of fun. The exercise I chose is weightlifting, since I have wanted to do it since I was 13. It is so much fun and I get childishly happy and proud whenever my trainer tells me that I have ""leveled up"". It makes me feel like I'm going super saiyan. I've never felt like I belonged in the gym, although no gym was ever unwelcoming to me. Yet now I am in the gym 6 days a week and feel quite at home.

Since you were beyond exhausted you managed to crash into bed and fall asleep without pulling on the handle. OK. I'll remember that.   Look at that! Your extreme exhaustion managed to let you finally sleep for a full night. But, you crashed so hard, and so fast that you never set an alarm and you slept for like 12 hours and now you're late for work....again. I know you're late, but **PULL THE HANDLE**.  Woo hoo! More IBS but it's Constipation this time, cold sensitivity, headache and extreme fatigue! Gee, you'd think that 12 hours of sleep would have solved that fatigue problem. Guess not! HEY BONUS ROUND!

c,"Well here’s my experience. I’m a natural 32G and have a petite little curvy body with a small waist. I’m 5’4 and weight about 130 lbs. Having heavy boobs does take a huge toll on your upper back area. Especially the neck and shoulders. I always wear a form-fitting sports bra on top of my regular bra and it helps alleviate the pressure off of my shoulders. I also see a chiropractor bi-monthly and have learned many tips from him. I’ve learned that your back pain will get worse if you don’t keep your back straight. Wearing a waist trainer or corset will force your back straight and it makes a huge load of a difference. It’s also recommended to wear one if you are going to engage in any athletic or strenuous activity. The last thing you want is to engage in any sports or exercise with weight or pressure on your shoulders causing you to hunch over. I only wear one when I have back or shoulder pain or when I’m going to engage in any type of strenuous activity. As for sleeping, well it is very uncomfortable to sleep with huge boobs unless you wear a sports bra to bed, which I always do.  I only free my twins when I’m naked. I can sleep on my back perfectly fine if I wanted too. The weight of implants on your chest is a bit different than the weight of big natural boobs, which is why it’s harder for a woman with large implants to sleep and breathe on her back. I can’t speak for all natural large chested women.

Saunas  and hot springs are known to offer this, and it is for good reason. The  heat that dissipates in the body helps increase blood flow and  circulation, which is critical for healing. It has the additional  benefit of reducing muscle spasms and increasing flexibility and range  of motion. On the other hand, cold therapy frees you from inflammation.  Therefore, it is also useful to have an alternate session of cold and  hot stones during your message.**Alleviates Your Stress &amp; Anxiety :**Stress  and anxiety are two conditions that people today treat daily. However,  some people find it harder to manage them than others. But, there are  options available, and one of them is massages.

For example, one study found that  15-minute massages in workplaces greatly reduced stress compared to  15-minute non-massage breaks.**Helps With Getting Sleep :**It  has also been shown to improve sleep, according to numerous studies.

s,"I [22F] have been experiencing multiple symptoms that seem to coalesce with having high cortisol levels/Cushings, but I’ve read stories about doctors adamantly denying patients when they claim they have symptoms like this disease. My symptoms are as follows: - weight gain of about 70 lb over the past year (have really not changed anything about my dieting or exercise) currently am 210 lb and have been around 150-170 lb my whole life. I am 5’5”. - left eye socket pain, throbs like a migraine of sorts, going on for about six months. Can have periods of remission where I don’t have it for about a week or can be daily. I saw an ophthalmologist for this and he told me to treat symptomatically with naproxen. Couldn’t find anything wrong on examination. - red/purple stretch marks on stomach that occurred randomly and developed about a year ago. Occurred out of the blue. - jaw that locks randomly especially when chewing food. On left side; same side as eye pain. - lower back pain (on left side and sometimes radiates down my leg). This pain started about a month ago randomly. I’m currently in PA school and sitting in lecture for 8 hours a day exacerbates the pain. Makes it hard to sleep. - extreme fatigue. I literally feel like I’m going to pass out in class and need to take naps when I get home from school. I sleep about 9 hours per night. I’ve always slept about 8-9 hours and have been fine my entire life. My PCP checked my thyroid levels and labs about a year ago because I was concerned about this fatigue and everything was fine. - random bruising. I have 7 bruises on my legs right now and have no idea how I got them. I’m on 50mg sertraline and have been for about 3 years; I’ve always thought my easy bruising was from this. - my boyfriend has noticed I have had a low libido for about three months now. I started the Nuvaring in August, so I thought this was the cause. - my boyfriend has also said that my mood has been “low” recently and that I’ve seemed “sad.” I feel like this is accurate and I have just been frustrated about not feeling like myself recently. - hypertension. As stated, I’m in PA school and we were practicing vital signs the other day. Mine was 152/98, and the next day it was 142/92. When getting prescribed the nuvaring in August, my blood pressure was 167/100. My gynecologist did not seem super concerned because I came back the next week and it was 138/82. It’s been relatively normal my whole life besides for slight white coat hypertension I’ve had in the past. Symptoms that I can’t tell if I actually have or if I just am trying to convince myself of having high cortisol/these symptoms: - a slight buffalo hump. My boyfriend does say there is a tiny hump. - increased urination. I have been urinating about every half hour to an hour and it wakes me up at night. This has been happening for about a month. I can’t tell if I’m just being paranoid or if I actually have something wrong with my cortisol levels. I have a doctors appointment in a week but am scared they’re going to dismiss my symptoms and not do any testing.  I’m just sick of not feeling like myself and it’s really not helping me and my success in PA school.

c,"I'm going to post paragraphs as I always do.  Let me preface this by saying that you should get evaluated by a professional because the post below is just conjecture based on how you're training, and you should make sure this isn't an issue that could become more serious. Lower back pain is an increasingly mysterious problem to me.  I used to think that it was entirely due to poor movement patterns or disease pathologies like slipped discs and tight hamstrings/hip flexors.  I also used to think that you could ""cure"" low back pain by improving movement or strengthening the  core muscles.  Research has shown that both of these claims are false even if they make intuitive sense.  Not everyone with a slipped disc has back pain, not everyone with back pain has a slipped disc or poor posture, and core strength does nothing to prevent pain. My best guess for you is that the rather impressive volume of this workout, combined with whatever other training you're doing, is just tiring you out.  I tend to err on the side of you not having biomechanical issues because you've been running for three years without pain, unless this is a separate injury that has cropped up.  And, as much as I hate to break this news, if you're hitting 20-25 reps of 50m sprints in 20 minutes, you're hitting high intensity intervals way too often. It could be that you're mechanically unsound, but I think this would have been an issue you'd have run into during your long distance running years as well.  The volume is probably what's killing you now - the combined intensity of the running and the number of intervals you're doing in a given stretch of time.  Your spinal stabilizers are likely fatigued to a point beyond which they're not functioning properly.  For the time being (ie until you can see a doctor to make sure this isn't something nastier), I'd recommend reducing the volume of these workouts and doing some endurance-based ""core"" training - static holds like planks (keep the abs and glutes contracted during the hold) or exercises where you raise your upper torso off the floor and hold that position for as long as you can.",0.587394,0.635196,0.815065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25268817204301075

c,"Hamilton, believe it or not. I saw it right after it had opened on Broadway, when it had local buzz but hadn't yet become a sensation, and the cast recording didn't exist yet. I got tickets for the rear balcony ($89 at the time!), went in beyond excited... and became lost about two sentences in. I'm not so up on my US history, and was having a really hard time telling one character from the next from that distance, especially since they're all wearing similar costumes. Forget understanding the lyrics - they obviously go a mile a minute. I left having felt like I saw something that was presumably amazing, and was glad to be in ""the room where it happened,"" but I had absolutely no idea what was going on which made it entirely unenjoyable. There was also an usher that was *constantly* walking back and forth in front of my seat (presumably, ironically, to prevent distractions), the people in front of me were making out through like 75% of the show, and I was dealing with bad lower back pain at the time that was really exacerbated by the horrible seating at the Rodgers. I was grumpy about the whole thing, and could not fathom how so many people were raving about it. But given the praise (and my love of In the Heights), I bought another ticket for over a year later, this time in row C of the orchestra. And what a difference!! At that the point the recording had come out, and while I still was having a hard time getting into it, I was at least able to listen to it to have a sense of what the hell was happening. Being able to see what was going on made all of the difference, and I spent most of the show with tears streaming down my face. (Amplified by the fact that Obama was giving his final speech in office that night at literally the same time that Washington was singing ""One Last Time."") I know this will be a little controversial here, but I also really, really loved Javier Munoz in it - he made Alexander so relatable to me, and I find his singing voice much more pleasant than LMM, so it made a big difference in the show. (I love LMM and think he's a genius writer, but admittedly am not really on board the LMM-as-singer train.) I'm also realizing how annoyingly spoiled this all sounds, that I was able to see Hamilton twice... but yeah. This is the clearest example of OP's question for me. Did a total 180.
